1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,055
We have covered some key Agile concepts in this lesson.

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:10,695
Hopefully, you will now appreciate while Agile has taken the market by storm.

3
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,900
In this lesson, we covered

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,220
some fundamental groundwork for developing our understanding of Agile.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,775
We first learn that Agile is a mindset.

6
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:26,910
It is essential to be agile and not just do the mechanics of what Agile recommends.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,925
We then went on to cover the Agile Manifesto.

8
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:32,630
We talked about how the need for Agile grew

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,550
organically as a result of experts realizing that there was a gap in

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,120
customer value delivery in many projects that

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,465
follow the traditional waterfall or process-centric structures.

12
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,240
We discussed the importance of

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,895
the four paired core values and their associated 12 guiding principles.

14
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:56,410
This lesson also talked about the difference between Agile and Waterfall.

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,430
The advantages and disadvantages of each were covered to ensure

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,120
everyone appreciates that one size does not necessarily fit all projects.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,890
In some instances, Waterfall may still be the optimal approach.

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,175
We finished up by talking about some misconceptions of Agile.

19
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,025
If you can avoid such misconceptions,

20
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:23,035
you will become a valuable member of an agile organization.

21
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:25,835
Moving on, in the next lesson,

22
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:30,900
we will dive into the topic of building and evolving successful Agile teams.
