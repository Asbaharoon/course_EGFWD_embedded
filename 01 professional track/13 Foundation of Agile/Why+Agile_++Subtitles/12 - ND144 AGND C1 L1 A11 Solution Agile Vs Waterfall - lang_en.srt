00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
In this exercise, we asked you to look at the weaknesses of

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,500
the waterfall approach to the Socialcare.gov project.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,150
You are asked to identify

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,115
at least two weaknesses and explain why you see them as weaknesses,

5
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:18,240
when compared to the Agile approach for Socialcare.gov.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,430
Let's look at my solution.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,470
The first weakness of waterfall planning is thorough documentation and paper trails.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,290
We can see that this is a weakness because instead of

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,775
focusing on actual working solutions of value to end users,

10
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:37,430
the team spent a significant amount of time on

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,510
creating and maintaining project documents.

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,190
That meant, the team lost focus on working solutions,

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,970
and time was taken away from valuable product development.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,025
An Agile approach would have ensured that the focus remains on working solutions,

15
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,820
as opposed to thorough documentation.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,070
The other weakness I identified is that

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,400
the testing process started once development was over.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,150
We can see this because all testing was planned and

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,965
conducted only after the development of the project was completed.

20
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:19,205
As a result, bugs were found later in development where they are expensive to fix.

21
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:23,630
An Agile approach would have included testing in each iteration.

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,155
This would have ensured built-in quality.

23
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,310
These are the problems I found.

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,440
Did you identify any other issues with the team using a waterfall approach?
