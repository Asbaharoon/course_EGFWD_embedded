1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Developing and delivering products which customers do not

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,910
want and for which there may not be a market can be an expensive adventure.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,240
Agile works to efficiently develop products where

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,755
the chances of it being valuable to customers and end users is enhanced.

5
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:22,590
Agile advocates for ensuring that the product strategy and execution remain aligned.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,330
The heartbeat of Agile is the iterative approach which allows for

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,340
adjustments to ensure value-driven items are delivered in short time frames.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,275
The proactive and transparent collaborative communication stands in Agile,

9
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:40,320
allows for constructive and genuine user and

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,275
market-driven insight to ensure the product is heading in the right direction.

11
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:48,885
Agile helps manage risks more proactively.

12
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:52,430
By evaluating project progress more frequently,

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,155
we are able to meaningfully evaluate during each iteration.

14
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:00,140
This helps the team measure delivered value,

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,640
as well as showcase working product to obtain realistic feedback.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,390
Specifically, risk reduction is accomplished through

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,079
iterative deliveries as requirements are discovered,

18
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,505
prioritized, and demoed to representatives from the business,

19
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:20,160
commonly referred to as business proxies in Agile.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,065
Agile exposes and provides the opportunity to recognize and manage risks early.

21
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,640
Risks are managed through

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,455
cross-functional teams that respect and understand each other's skill sets,

23
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:36,125
sustainable and predictable pace,

24
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,205
continuous feedback, and technical excellence,

25
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,760
that is built-in quality.

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,755
This transparency ensures risks are managed early.

27
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:52,745
Building and delivering high-quality products requires a commitment,

28
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:58,835
but the business benefits and value delivered justify this investment.

29
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:02,630
The business benefits from elevated customer satisfaction,

30
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,565
as well as better velocity,

31
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:09,665
which is essentially a measure of how much valuable work was completed in an iteration.

32
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:11,690
The business also benefits for

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,325
a more predictable pace of the products incremental delivery.

34
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:19,550
A more reliable solution environment

35
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,855
enables an agile team to confidently innovate and scale.

36
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:28,700
Agile emboldens the culture by encouraging open communication,

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,330
collaboration, and a cohesiveness driven by a common business value-driven goal.

38
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,760
By breaking down silos,

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,395
Agile promotes a more adaptable work environment that boost morale,

40
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:47,575
prevents burnout, and encourages a highly productive, sustainable pace.

41
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,865
When treated with respect,

42
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,710
Agile team members evolve

43
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,105
their practices and find opportunities that benefit the business.

44
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,090
This aspiration is elevated when

45
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,540
Agile teams understand the larger purpose behind their work.
