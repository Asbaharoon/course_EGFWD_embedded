1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
Efficiency and effectiveness.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,335
This is a fine balancing act that Agile recommends.

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:12,165
If you're only focused on going fast, you prioritize efficiency.

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:17,385
But if you are trying to focus on innovation, creativity,

5
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,580
and making sure you're working on the right thing,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,345
you need to focus on effectiveness.

7
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:26,455
This is often done at the cost of efficiency.

8
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:29,590
Agile ensures a balanced approach,

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,045
whereby Agile teams ensure that there is a balance between speed and creativity.

10
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:41,510
Agile principles specifically recommend customer satisfaction by delivering

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,900
product features and functionality with built-in quality that

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,665
offer business value that customer is kept satisfied.

13
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:52,340
Customer satisfaction is further increased because they're

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,510
requested features are delivered not only early in the project life cycle,

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,445
but also continuously, as a product has evolved and enhanced based on market feedback.

16
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:09,305
Agile projects include a product owner who is an individual responsible for ensuring

17
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:15,185
clear translation of what the customer wants into product requirements.

18
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:19,235
Agile helps teams keep the vision and focus.

19
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:22,400
The vision drives what is to be included and

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,475
excluded in the list of features and functionality,

21
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:29,240
which is customarily called a product backlog in Agile.

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,000
Agile is the deliberate goal of setting challenging but very realistic expectations,

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,700
helps ensure that the business owners needs are being

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,640
prioritized and met while effectively managing their expectations.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,430
In Agile, milestones and accomplishments are based on

26
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,634
demonstrable results through the objective evaluation of working systems.

27
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:55,520
Such demos give the business owners an opportunity to

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,630
ensure that the Agile teams work is aligned with the vision.

29
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:05,215
Agile works well in the development of complex dynamic systems.

30
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:10,890
For example, self-organizing interactions among the Agile team,

31
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,930
they give rise to outcomes that may be different from or

32
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,210
in addition to any anticipated or targeted outcomes.

33
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:26,185
The initially unplanned, yet valuable results can emerge in such circumstances.

34
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:31,460
Agile frameworks are designed to accommodate such emergent needs.

35
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,390
Agile project management includes many practices, tools,

36
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,805
and artifacts to improve predictability,

37
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:39,920
which helps reduce risk.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,070
Agile's adaptive planning approach is

39
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,585
an iterative approach which organizes several information flows,

40
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:51,530
analyses, issues, and opinions that

41
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,810
coalesce into predictable decisions that align with the strategy.

42
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:02,180
For example, successful agile organizations keep the same iteration length,

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,435
and Agile team allocation throughout the product development life-cycle.

44
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:10,925
This ensures some structure within the chaos.

45
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:16,535
This also enables the project team to predict the exact cost for each iteration.

46
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:21,320
Let's take another look at the list of reasons why companies are switching to Agile.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,720
I hope you understand now why so many people are excited about Agile.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,010
Today's digitally complex and interconnected business world

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,930
is driving organizations to seek avenues to increase speed to market,

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,780
meet customer demand, and increase team productivity.

51
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,630
Organizations want to use Agile to get there by

52
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,860
developing products better, faster, and cheaper.
