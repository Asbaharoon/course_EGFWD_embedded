00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
In this section, we will differentiate between Agile and Waterfall approaches.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,910
We will discuss the benefits of Agile over Waterfall,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,755
and we will even explain when Waterfall is a better approach than Agile.

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:19,410
The Waterfall model is a more stringent and process-driven style,

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,100
where the project is broken down into project activities through

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,190
structured phases with toll gates established to formulate review progress.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,980
In Waterfall, each phase typically depends on the deliverables of the previous one.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,215
The focus is on the work to be done and not delivering functional vertical slices.

9
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:47,485
Waterfall is quite common for elements of high capital expenditure engineering projects.

10
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:53,005
Waterfall fixes the scope and estimates time and cost.

11
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,665
Agile breaks this paradigm,

12
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:59,935
because Agile fixes time and cost,

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,250
and allows scoped to be flexible.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,250
Product development life-cycle is an iterations

15
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,180
versus product development life-cycle is divided into strict,

16
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:19,380
distinct phases, an incremental approaches is used versus a sequential design process.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,815
Agile embraces change versus a stringent in more formal change management approach.

18
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:30,650
In Agile, a product mindset is

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,760
used where the product satisfies the needs of its customers and

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,345
adapts per the customers priorities versus

21
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:43,555
a project mindset with focus completely on accomplishing the project.

22
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:47,480
In Agile, small dedicated teams with

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,245
a high degree of cross-functional collaboration exist,

24
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,855
versus the Waterfall world,

25
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:58,510
where team coordination and synchronization is limited.

26
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:05,535
In Agile, product owners with the Agile team prepare the requirements incrementally.

27
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:08,030
Whereas in the Waterfall world,

28
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,155
business analysts prepare requirements before the product development begins.

29
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:18,075
The Agile team is self-directed and self-organized,

30
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,285
whereas in the Waterfall world,

31
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:24,485
the project manager directs and manages the product team.

32
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:28,100
The Stacey diagram is a popular method to select

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,180
the appropriate project or product management style.

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,200
Essentially, if there is a lack of agreement and

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,330
clarity in terms of both the requirements and as well as process,

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,600
then an Agile approach will not magically help with such chaos,

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,200
where there is no clear vision and no road map.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,530
Now, when there is near certainty on both the requirements and process upfront,

39
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,499
then there may not be as much value in utilizing

40
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:02,615
Agile principles because there isn't much need for iterative learning and adapting.

41
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:09,170
Agile works best in an environment of complexity and some uncertainty,

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,495
where an adaptive approach is needed to deliver maximum value.

43
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:16,460
Agile is also useful in delivering

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,840
valuable results when working with complicated requirements.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,620
They need iterative cycles to understand that genuine needs of the end users.

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,050
Agile is not a magical solution for chaos.

47
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,890
That is, it cannot be recklessly bring value

48
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,420
to an environment where there is no vision and no clear road map.

49
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,250
Again, Agile also does not really make a lot of sense for simple,

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,655
predictable projects and products where the need for

51
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:51,480
iterative learning and adapting is of no value.
