1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,155
The Agile Manifesto's four-paired core values drive the 12 Agile principles.

2
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:10,350
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,635
through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

4
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:15,930
Let us not forget that the goal of

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,830
product development is the development of successful products.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,750
An evolutionary approach to product development works better for complex systems.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,250
Then defining everything upfront before the team starts to develop.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,490
Welcome changing requirements even late in development.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,295
Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

10
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:44,250
Due to the dynamic competitive landscape,

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,480
requirements can and will change throughout product development.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,400
Traditional software developers adopt change

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,470
management processes which are designed to prevent or reduce scope creep.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,300
But when you think about it,

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,635
these are really unnatural change prevention processes,

16
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,590
not change management processes.

17
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,520
Agile lists embrace change and instead

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,720
proposing adaptive or agile change management approach,

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,380
which treats requirements as a prioritized backlog,

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,060
which is how to get refined over time.

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,215
Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,

22
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:30,830
with a preference giving to the shorter timescale.

23
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,170
Frequent and iterative delivery of

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,160
working product provides the business with practical feedback.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,390
This transparency provides an opportunity for the business

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,695
and the development team to sync up more frequently in terms of direction,

27
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:50,625
product goal, and what value is anticipated for the product.

28
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:55,525
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

29
00:01:55,525 --> 00:02:01,225
The product owner, who represents the business stakeholders and the Agile team,

30
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:05,965
adopt practices that ensure inclusive and joint practices,

31
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:10,745
which enables a product owner to be actively involved with product development.

32
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:14,365
Build projects around motivated individuals,

33
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:19,870
give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

34
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,460
Agile leaders build Agile teams with skilled resources,

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,875
who are willing to work together collaboratively with a growth mindset.

36
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,800
They have the humble and respectful realization that

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,850
people are a primary success factor in product development.

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,005
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information

39
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:46,705
to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

40
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:49,820
For a product development team to succeed,

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,340
its members must communicate and collaborate effectively.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,105
Face-to-face communication, utilizing a shared information radiator,

43
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:03,265
such as a shared drawing environment is one effective example.

44
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:06,680
With increasingly global teams located remotely,

45
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,620
telepresence technology can be leveraged to

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,040
build this virtual face-to-face type communication.

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,150
Working software is the primary measure of progress.

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,170
The primary measure of product development should be the delivery of

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,290
working product increments which meet the evolving needs of the business.

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,095
Agile processes promote sustainable development.

51
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:33,335
The sponsors, developers, and users

52
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:37,285
should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

53
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:42,140
A highly skilled team simply just cannot be expected to successfully

54
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,540
develop a product by compelling people to work overtime for extended periods.

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,355
Complex technical work is best done at an intense,

56
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:55,405
yet realistically sustainable pace.

57
00:03:55,405 --> 00:04:00,605
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

58
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:04,190
Built-in quality practices have enormous benefits.

59
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,449
It allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the product, coding standards,

60
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,720
best practices related to refactoring and test development techniques are

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,035
some examples of built-in quality practices that are prevalent in strong Agile teams.

62
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:27,725
Simplicity. The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

63
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,080
With the guidance or the product owner.

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,755
Agile teams focus on high-value activities,

65
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:38,045
which allows them to focus on the high business value needs.

66
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:44,915
The lower value items are given a lower priority and only worked on if time permits.

67
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,660
The best architectures, requirements,

68
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,680
and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,905
This is a critical principle of the Agile world

70
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:58,340
to ensure that emerging and effective architectures,

71
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,550
requirements, and designs are built into

72
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,275
the product development life cycle to maximize technical excellence.

73
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:08,270
At regular intervals.

74
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,240
The team reflects on how to become more effective,

75
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,479
then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

76
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,915
Finding concrete opportunities for improvement is a continual effort.

77
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:22,370
Agile embeds techniques such as

78
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,325
retrospectives to ensure continual improvement is followed through upon.

79
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:30,650
As you can see, the Agile Manifesto is

80
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,240
four-paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,170
a solid foundation four the various agile frameworks that are currently

82
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,220
being practiced by successful organizations in today's digital age.
