1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
This exercise has two parts.

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:07,800
First, you are asked to look at the paired core values and identify

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,050
which two particularly stand out as being absent at SocialKare.gov.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,600
Second, you are asked to consider the Agile Principles and identify

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,020
which of the 12 Agile Principles would have been beneficial to adopt at Socialkare.gov.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,755
Your answers might be different, but here are mine.

7
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:31,560
The first missing paired core value from

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,255
the Agile Manifesto is individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

9
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:41,135
Despite heavy government mandated processes,

10
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:46,595
the lack of team cohesion and a siloed approach to delegating work,

11
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:52,280
with an autocratic management style impeded the quality of the results.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,940
Then demotivated and fatigued team produced a subpar set of project deliverables.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,485
Working software over comprehensive documentation was also missing.

14
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,670
Despite the paper trail,

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,120
a lot of the documentation was ineffective.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,230
No demos for a working prototype were presented,

17
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,515
so there was no early and regular feedback.

18
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:19,070
The tangible results were inadequate at the end,

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,545
the feedback loop was broken with no opportunity for early feedback.

20
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:28,955
The first missing principle I noticed is simplicity,

21
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,535
the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.

22
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:39,020
At SocialKare.gov, we can see that an unnecessarily heavy and,

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,230
unprioritized set of requirements forced

24
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,480
the team to work on non-value added requirements.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,695
This lack of an agiled mindset added muda or waste to the results.

26
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,960
The second missing principle is,

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,170
our highest priority is to satisfy

28
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,240
the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,410
This was clearly missing at SocialKare.gov.

30
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,130
With no delivery of functionality

31
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,740
incrementally and no periodic product demos during the project lifecycle,

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,180
SocialKare.gov services and capabilities were not formally able to

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,135
be verified and validated until the project was in its last phase.

34
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:24,615
This delayed the feedback loop.

35
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:30,170
It also left the business users and ultimately the end-users unsatisfied.

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,500
This principle would have encouraged a team to utilize

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,620
demos and other feedback loops to get

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,635
working features in front of the business users for

39
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:44,275
early feedback and make it shippable for release on demand.

40
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:50,975
Another missing principle, is welcome changing requirements even late in development.

41
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:55,850
Agile processes harness change for the competitive advantage.

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,490
We can see evidence that this principle was

43
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,415
missing because requirements or functionality were changing

44
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,310
even at the tail end of the project and

45
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,680
changes had to go through a stringent change control review.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,495
That resulted in delays responding to functional change requests.

47
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:19,070
A more adaptive change management approach in an Agile environment would have

48
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:25,130
allowed for a more change-embracing approach with fewer hurdles and fewer delays.

49
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,270
Also, the team is missing.

50
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:34,070
The business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

51
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,300
We can see this because the development team did not actively

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,145
engaged those business users who best understood the needs of the end-users.

53
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:49,085
This resulted in a delayed feedback loop and a lack of team confidence.

54
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:52,820
Had this happened, the early feedback loop would have

55
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,905
allowed business users to provide valuable insight.

56
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:00,350
The developers would also have felt more confident and

57
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,825
motivated in knowing that the direction they were heading in was the right one.

58
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,790
These are the missing principles that I identified.

59
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,690
Did you see these or did you find any others?

60
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,290
As an agilist, you'll want to make sure that your team

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,949
follows the Agile Manifesto principles as much as possible.
