1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Agile significant global adoption is driven by the discovery that the only way for

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,250
successful teams to cope with

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,455
today's turbulent customer driven marketplace is to become agile.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:20,985
Agile enables teams and organizations to effectively manage continuous change.

5
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:27,435
It permits teams to flourish in an environment that is increasingly volatile,

6
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:31,965
uncertain, complex, and ambiguous,

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,035
also known as VUCA.

8
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:38,010
Volatility is when there are unexpected or unstable

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,025
possibilities that may influence the work being done.

10
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:45,080
Uncertainty refers to the extent to which

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,820
an organization can confidently predict or forecast the future.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,230
More uncertainty makes it harder to predict.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,670
Complexity exists when there are

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,100
many interconnected parts and variables that influence each other.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,610
Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity such as not having

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,390
a clear understanding of the genuine needs of the customer and then users.

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,255
What is agile exactly?

18
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:17,870
Agile is a set of principles that guide how we as individuals,

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:26,425
as teams, and as organizations think about as well as act upon the work that we do.

20
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:33,605
Business agility is the ability of an organization to adapt quickly to market changes,

21
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:40,025
respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense,

22
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:42,770
as well as adapt and lead the change in

23
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,830
a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality.

24
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,920
An agile mindset is the set of attitudes supporting an agile working environment.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,529
When we talk about an agile mindset,

26
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:02,120
we include respect, collaboration, continuous improvement,

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,764
iterative learning cycles, mastery and ownership,

28
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:07,760
focus on delivering value,

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,280
and adaptability to change.

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,805
Respect is critical for successful teamwork.

31
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:16,340
At the organizational level,

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,230
respect for associates at all levels of the organization, the customer,

33
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,190
and the prioritized product backlog,

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,025
which is a prioritized list of work for the Agile team,

35
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:32,435
which itself is key to delivering excellent products and solutions.

36
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,265
Collaboration is also important.

37
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:40,130
With increasingly complex systems across functional and scale,

38
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,800
the team is needed to find solutions.

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,310
A collaborative approach will decrease the number of

40
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,335
inefficient handoffs necessary to deliver the product.

41
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:55,685
Continuous improvement is an important built-in quality mindset

42
00:02:55,685 --> 00:03:00,430
where quality is a habitual part of the organization's DNA.

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,515
Organizations that support agile teams

44
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:07,730
firmly believe there's always room for improvement.

45
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,200
Iterative learning cycles allow agile teams to

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,715
exhibit and execute on an agile or growth mindset.

47
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:20,330
This growth mindset is an attitude that turns

48
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,950
apparent failures into growth opportunities for learning.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,675
This ties in with the already discussed belief that agile teams can improve over time,

50
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,820
that our abilities are not fixed,

51
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,170
but rather evolve as new emergent ideas are cultivated.

52
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,000
The ability to develop mastery and having a sense of ownership in the project

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,745
deliverables increases the desire to deliver high quality work.

54
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:48,890
The value-driven delivery perspective ensures

55
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,265
agile teams maintain a customer satisfaction centric culture.

56
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:58,700
This equates at a minimum to agile teams ensuring that

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,935
the customer needs are paramount when focusing on delivering value.

58
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,410
Embracing changes that make

59
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,935
a business value sense is a cornerstone to successful agile teams.

60
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:18,110
Heavy processes to manage such changes must be tempered to ensure

61
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,420
they do not become an impediment to

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,325
enabling changes that make business and economic sense.

63
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:28,985
The agile mindset cultivates high performing teams,

64
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:34,220
which in turn deliver quantum value for their customers and business owners.

65
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,005
The agile mindset is the bedrock of being agile.

66
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:44,840
Some organizations and agile teams unfortunately just focus on doing agile.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,600
This equates to simply adopting

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,585
the practices without committing to or exhibiting agile principles and values.

69
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:59,270
Being agile is the foundation that truly elevates individuals, teams,

70
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,700
and organizations to unleash

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,235
their latent potential to deliver monumental and focused value.

72
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:09,740
Being agile implies living and breathing

73
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,975
agile principles and values through agile practices consistently every day.

74
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:18,830
The more time I spend with agile initiatives across the world,

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,280
the more I realize that understanding this difference

76
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,495
is absolutely vital for successful agile transformations.

77
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,730
When agile teams are being agile,

78
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,410
is a clearly directed sharp focus that gives

79
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,345
everyone a purpose aligned with the organization's vision,

80
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:42,050
autonomy to self-direct, as well as an opportunity for

81
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,279
cultivating mastery to unleash immense value.
