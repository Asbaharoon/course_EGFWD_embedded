1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,545
Agile experts, or agilists as we'd like to call ourselves,

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:07,530
adopt a practical and realistic approach to delivering

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,640
the best value and quality in the shortest sustainable time.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,950
Agilists take into account an understanding of the economics of delivering products.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,850
In other words, decisions by Agile experts are made within a proper economic context

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,470
where we ensure that it makes

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,125
financial sense to proceed with developing a particular feature or feature set.

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:38,810
Agile experts also take into account the trade-offs between risks and uncertainties,

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,500
as well as operational and development costs.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,480
In other words, a systems thinking approach reinforced by

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,340
a growth mindset helps Agile experts deliver optimal business value.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,655
With a traditional mindset,

13
00:00:56,655 --> 00:01:00,680
we look at the pieces of the solution within their separate elements.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,535
But the roots of systems thinking is in systems theory,

15
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:08,300
which looks at the interdependent and interconnected components of

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,580
a system that come together to deliver a solution in a cohesive manner.

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,470
Systems thinking takes a holistic approach in which the Agile team looks

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,390
at the way a system's components interrelated influence each other,

19
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,300
and how these components come together within

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,725
the context of larger systems to deliver a solution.

21
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:34,970
Systems thinking helps Agile teams see beyond the heart of

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,865
a problem to find valuable and sustainable solutions that deliver measurable benefits.

23
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:48,320
Agile experts appreciate that optimizing a component does not optimize the entire system.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,440
Systems thinking helps Agile teams work to

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,300
understand the larger aim of the entire system.

26
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,010
Systems thinking is about seeing the product in

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,580
motion through system demos or presentations,

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,250
in which the end users get a sense of what the functional experience will actually be,

29
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,650
recognizing that the big picture is rarely static,

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:16,355
but almost always a web of factors that interact to create patterns and change over time.

31
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:20,270
Systems thinking becomes a catalyst for Agile experts to

32
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,770
catapult the organization's learning and continuous improvement journey.

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,080
In a growth mindset,

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,915
individuals on a team have the mindset that

35
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:34,210
their abilities can grow through dedication and hard work.

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,830
Agilists give credence to a growth mindset.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,240
They are able to elevate Agile teams to believe that

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,075
their most basic abilities can blossom through dedication and hard work.

39
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:50,420
This view creates a passion for learning and the resilience

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,940
that is essential for Agile teams to accomplish astounding results.

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,660
This growth mindset is balanced with ethics, principles,

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,560
and indeed values that have much to do with concepts enshrined

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,720
in corporate governance and corporate social responsibility.

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,400
Agilists do not just provide lip service to

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,010
high sounding words like integrity, commitment, and respect.

46
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,350
Instead, agilists ensure that

47
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,850
such enduring principles do not get sacrificed in the face of expedience,

48
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:30,509
thereby ensuring organizations do not resort to pursuing business results at any cost.
