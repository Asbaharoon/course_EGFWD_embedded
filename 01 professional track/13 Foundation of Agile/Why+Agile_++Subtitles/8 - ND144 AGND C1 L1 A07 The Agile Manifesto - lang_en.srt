1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
In order to appreciate the Agile Manifesto,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,915
we need to look at what led it to being created by 17 thought leaders in 2001.

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:11,345
Up until the late 1990s,

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,360
majority of product development followed

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,330
a waterfall-style project management life cycle

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,360
that was based on adhering to strict processes.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,540
Product development teams focused heavily on gathering detailed requirements upfront.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,320
The contract between the development team and

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,500
customer became the primary focus of the delivery,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,150
resulting in value taking on a secondary level of importance.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,640
Products started to get more complex with several interconnected pieces,

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,855
that got discovered and entangled further down the development pipeline.

13
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:49,250
This resulted in delays which

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,515
further frustrated customers and impacted their bottom line.

15
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,540
To add to the woes,

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,510
final product delivery would often have features and functionality

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,055
that did not work as expected or anticipated by the customer.

18
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:09,890
The whole product procedure was process centric with the goal of delivering

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,695
the product successfully rather than focusing on delivering a successful product.

20
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:20,030
This is what led 17 experts to get together and finalize

21
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,770
the Agile Manifesto at a meeting in Utah, back in 2001.

22
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,760
The four agile core values or better

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,200
stated as the four paired core values are listed here.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,470
Again, these were developed by 17 industry experts who finalized this in 2001.

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,950
Let's walk through each one.

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,405
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

27
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:50,450
Agile places more importance and emphasis on people

28
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,790
and their interactions over processes and even tools.

29
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,305
After all, it is the skilled human resources,

30
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:01,355
when given a purpose, motivation,

31
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,110
and a suitable environment,

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,810
who respond to business needs and drive

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,790
the development process to successfully deliver a valuable product.

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,030
Processes and tools by their very nature are less responsive to change.

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,560
Working software over comprehensive documentation.

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,130
Documentation requires a time and resource commitment.

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,660
A heavy focus on documentation leads to

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,570
slower processes that businesses are looking to

39
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,990
mitigate in a market that requires rapid action.

40
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,140
Moreover, some of the documentation can be

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,200
redundant and just not as useful to the Agile team,

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,840
the business users, or even those looking for

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,015
reliable trace of the valuable work being accomplished.

44
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,230
Now, let's be clear here.

45
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,780
Agile is about streamlining, not eliminating documentation.

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,550
However, while documentation has its value,

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,300
in the Agile mindset,

48
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,120
it is working solutions that are paramount.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,840
Agile clearly states that we get more traction from

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,000
working software that can be presented to the business.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,035
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

52
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:22,700
Agile promotes a collaborative outlook when product owners work

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,445
with their customers in reaching agreement on the details of the product delivery.

54
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:29,120
This is in contrast to

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,250
traditional project management methodologies in which both sides exhaustively

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,950
negotiate requirements for the product in

57
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,785
tremendous detail before the product development work even begins.

58
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:47,630
Agile in contrast, suggests a more practical approach by including

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,970
the customer throughout the life cycle of

60
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,155
the product delivery to ensure continual feedback.

61
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:58,985
Responding to change over following a plan.

62
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:03,355
Every Agilist will tell you that Agile embraces change.

63
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:07,880
When working with a more traditional project management methodology,

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,130
changes often have an inefficient and multi-step formal review process.

65
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:20,179
In such circumstances, changes are often seen as to be avoided since supposedly,

66
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:22,010
all the requirements were documented,

67
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,290
reviewed, and approved upfront.

68
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,510
However, Agile intentionally works to maximize the power of

69
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,935
progressive elaboration through short iterations

70
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:36,315
which allows for easier value driven changes.

71
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:40,010
Agile truly embraces changes that make

72
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,985
practical and business sense as a means to improve a product and add value.

73
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,320
The goal is not to police change request stringently, but rather,

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,000
to continue to challenge ourselves to

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,235
identify changes that can add additional business value.

76
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:04,020
The Agile Manifesto is four paired core values drive the 12 Agile principles.
