1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,360
Why are forward thinking organizations rabidly adopting Agile?

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,450
Why are we seeing that global professional bodies such as

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,530
the Project Management Institute or PMI in their PMBOK Guide,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,705
and the International Institute of Business Analysis or IIBA in their BABOK guide,

5
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:23,925
have incorporated and highlighted the importance of Agile in project management,

6
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:28,155
business analysis, and other product delivery activities.

7
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:33,180
In an increasingly interconnected and competitive global market space,

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,320
I am seeing Agile being leveraged by successful organizations

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,655
across the globe to thrive in today's digital economy.

10
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,770
Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,715
in a world where we are constantly being challenged with volatility,

12
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:53,860
uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,270
Organizations that I have seen go through

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,990
Agile transformation have benefited from the following.

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,375
Faster time to market.

16
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:06,500
An Agile approach accelerates product development cycles.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,585
According to various studies,

18
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:12,640
Agile teams are able to release products anywhere from 50-80 percent

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,110
faster that teams that continue to

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,139
use a more traditional approach to product development.

21
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,715
Early return on investment.

22
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,470
On the ROI front,

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,475
Agile helps us accomplish two things: help squeeze cash out of work in progress,

24
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:30,185
also known as WIP,

25
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,905
and increase project and portfolio returns.

26
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:36,175
Let's look at each of these.

27
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:42,890
In Agile, by not allocating funds up front and hampering organizational liquidity,

28
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,505
cash is freed up to more flexibly invest as the product evolves based on market needs.

29
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:54,515
Waste, commonly referred to as the Japanese term Muda in the real-world,

30
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:58,700
is reduced by trimming down on unproven assumptions and

31
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,050
mitigating the chances when investing in non-value added features.

32
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,065
That is, features that are of no value and are probably a waste of resources.

33
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:12,800
This helps a product management team prioritize features more

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,419
proactively and steer towards better decisions for product's success.

35
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:22,565
Agile allows us to fail fast or even stop early.

36
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,400
This allows executives to move funds around

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,505
from one project to another at a portfolio level.

38
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:31,490
Priorities are re-evaluated more frequently and

39
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,490
proactively to maintain a close alignment to the pulse of the market.

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,370
As Eric Reis outlines in his book, The Lean Startup,

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,460
that early feedback loop from the customer or

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,065
a proxy who represents the customer is priceless.

43
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:50,840
Frequent feedback from the business and end-users ensures

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,580
the Agile team is focused on the solutions and intended goals,

45
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,665
and helps ensure they deliver high-value features.

46
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:02,930
Equally important, feedback loops allow

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,879
the team to accommodate change later in the development process,

48
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,450
particularly as newer refined requirements emerge.
