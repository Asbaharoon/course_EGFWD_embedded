1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Let's get started with learning all about agile.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,105
This lesson will focus on the following;

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:10,200
the Agile mindset and value-driven delivery benefits of agile.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,290
You will be able to differentiate between doing

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,475
Agile versus being agile by the end of this lesson.

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,435
As mentioned earlier, this lesson will focus on

7
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:28,830
the Agile mindset and how it sets the tone for being agile versus just doing Agile.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,560
The Agile Manifesto and how it is seen as the foundational set of

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,840
four paired core values and

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,405
12 principles that sets the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

11
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:43,220
We will also compare Agile versus

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,390
the more traditional Waterfall approaches to product development.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,270
We will wrap up the lesson with an important discussion

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,270
on common misconceptions about Agile.

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,220
By the end of this lesson,

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,019
you will be able to explain

17
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:02,080
the Agile mindset and value-driven delivery benefits of Agile.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,810
That's going to be great because you will be able to explain to others why

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,760
Agile is so great for complex product development.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,820
Differentiate between doing Agile and being agile.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,055
I hope you won't see a lot of people doing Agile rather than being Agile.

22
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:21,575
But if you do, you'll know it

23
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:25,225
and you'll be able to guide the team in the right direction.

24
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,990
Explain the Agile Manifesto's four paired core values,

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,230
which will set the tone for everything you do in Agile.

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:39,725
Identify and apply the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto and know here to apply them.

27
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,975
Differentiate between Agile and Waterfall approaches,

28
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:46,310
and where each makes sense.

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,610
Let's get started with learning all about Agile.
