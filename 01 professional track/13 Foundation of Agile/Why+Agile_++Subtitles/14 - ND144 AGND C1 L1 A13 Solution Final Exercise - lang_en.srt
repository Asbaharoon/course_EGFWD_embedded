1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,045
In this exercise, we ask you to think about the situation at SocialKare.gov and

2
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:12,870
outline three recommendations to set in place a more Agile Mindset at SocialKare.gov.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,960
We ask you to take into account the Agile Manifesto in

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,175
your recommendation and avoid the negative pitfalls of waterfall.

5
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,425
Let's look at what I came up with.

6
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:27,510
The first strategy I'd recommend is ensuring management commitment.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,900
Any successful Agile transformation initiative requires a serious management commitment.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,680
This senior commitment ensures

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,760
strategic input and support by identifying critical business goals,

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,790
providing the necessary realistic support and

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,690
resources to meet the established expectations.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,120
As product development progresses,

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,140
continuing to receive clear direction from executives on aligning

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,050
the product with the organization's strategic goals

15
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,435
can have a significant positive impact.

16
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,535
From a resourcing perspective,

17
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:04,730
management support ensures that a capable product owner,

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,150
facilitator, and Agile team are put together to deliver successful results.

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,890
Finally, as a last resort,

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,035
senior management can play a critical role in removing significant roadblocks.

21
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:24,535
The second strategy I'd recommend is to provide the team autonomy by empowering them.

22
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:29,090
A decentralized decision-making model where timely decisions are

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,085
critical for moving the product development forward is needed in Agile environments.

24
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:37,730
The only decisions that should remain centralized with

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,425
senior management are the long-term strategic and financial ones.

26
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,530
Having the right resources on the Agile team,

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,120
who are capable decision-makers with cross-functional skills

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,630
will help facilitate the decision-making process at SocialKare.gov.

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,865
The product owner, facilitator,

30
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,360
and Agile team must be empowered to

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,515
become self-managing and collaborative at SocialKare.gov.

32
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:10,220
The product owner and facilitator will obviously need

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,610
to ensure collaboration and involvement of

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,180
the stakeholder community at the appropriate times to keep

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,950
products on track and outcomes aligned with business needs.

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,950
A third success strategy is incorporating adaptive planning with relevant buy-in.

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,190
It all begins with an inspiring product vision,

38
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,695
which represents the future state of SocialKare.gov and its product offering.

39
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:39,815
This future state vision should be created by the sponsors,

40
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:43,640
with this vision being crystal-clear for the product owner,

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,725
the vision drives all other elements of adaptive planning.

42
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:51,490
The next layer of adaptive planning is a product roadmap.

43
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,610
The roadmap, typically presented visually with a timeline,

44
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,800
outlines a product functionality planned for each time period.

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,149
This roadmap will progressively evolve over time.

46
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,675
This is followed by a Release Plan.

47
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:12,740
If the team has a well-refined set of requirements for the first few iterations,

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,755
initial Release Plan should comfortably be able to cover the first 2-3 releases.

49
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:20,210
This has to be balanced with the need to remain

50
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,540
flexible and adaptable with an Agile mindset.

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,375
Planning out in tremendous details too far out is not recommended.

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,340
Once a release plan is in place,

53
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,750
Iteration Plan should follow in which SocialKare.gov takes

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,450
a prioritized backlog and breaks them

55
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,920
down into iterations with a business priority focus.

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,425
Finally, SocialKare.gov could benefit through an informal level of daily planning,

57
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,810
which is a natural fringe benefit of

58
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,980
the daily stand-ups recommended by virtually all Agile Frameworks.

59
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,690
This ensures we're proactively dealing with anything important that comes up.

60
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,600
What strategies did you come up with to make

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,830
SocialKare.gov more successful in setting an Agile Framework?
