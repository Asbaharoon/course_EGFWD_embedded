1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,165
As Agile becomes more accepted by the market,

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:07,200
I continue to see a number of detrimental anti-patterns and

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,305
misconceptions that are preventing organizations from truly realizing the value of Agile.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,430
I'm going to share five of the ones I see as more common that can

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,709
relatively easily be rectified if the Agile mindset is kept in focus.

6
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:28,905
Misconception number 1, scheduling Agile Ceremonies makes a team Agile.

7
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,995
Just holding Agile Ceremonies,

8
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:38,440
such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives does not equate to a team becoming Agile.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,310
The ceremonies are a vital part of virtually all Agile Frameworks,

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,380
but just holding them for the sake of it does not necessarily deliver any benefits.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,925
In order for an Agile Team to realize the gains from ceremonies,

12
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:56,570
it is important to adhere to the core principles of Agile.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,210
I see many organizations continue to have

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,825
managers in these ceremonies who continue to be directive,

15
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:09,050
which kills the opportunity for collaboration, self-direction, and self-organization.

16
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,970
Misconception number 2, the facilitator role is filled by a traditional Project Manager.

17
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,410
While leaders will acknowledge

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,830
the valuable role of facilitator in any Agile Framework place,

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,040
such as the Scrum Master and Scrum.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,990
In reality, many a times

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,055
this facilitator role continues to be a traditional project manager.

22
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:36,260
The reason this is a challenge for many leaders with the right intention,

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,650
is that this facilitator role generally does not

24
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,610
have any equivalent in the traditional project management team structure.

25
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,400
Now, it is entirely possible for

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,980
a former traditional Project Manager to

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,205
step in and play this facilitator role brilliantly,

28
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:56,410
but it's certainly requires the Agile Mindset shift.

29
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,525
The facilitator role is absolutely critical.

30
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,760
In many Agile Frameworks,

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,370
this role is responsible for facilitating,

32
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,725
coaching and really is the Uber Servant Leader who works with everyone and

33
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,680
anyone to mitigate impediments and

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,445
assist in whatever can help the Agile team move forward.

35
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:21,245
This individual does not and should not manage the Agile team.

36
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:26,645
This is where I see a lot of organizations struggle when transitioning to Agile.

37
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:30,650
Misconception number 3, Agile team size

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,075
is justified to be larger than Agile Frameworks recommend.

39
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:39,740
Agile recommend small cross-functional teams to allow for

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,545
the nimbleness to remain flexible yet

41
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:46,249
powerful enough to deliver value in every iteration.

42
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:52,100
Unfortunately, I see a lot of larger Agile team sizes being blessed by leaders in

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,025
organizations that are supposedly moving towards

44
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:59,630
Agile because they feel that their circumstances are unique.

45
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,540
The problem with teams that are larger than somewhere close to

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,220
15 is that it becomes challenging to track everyone's work,

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,900
and consolidate it all into

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,295
a minimum shippable product at the end of every short iteration.

49
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:17,240
Misconception number 4, the product backlog is

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,020
managed analogous to a traditional requirements document.

51
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,140
Product backlogs can be presented in many forms,

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,490
but the one thing that should never be is just a pretty front end for

53
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,215
traditional plan driven and process-driven requirements document.

54
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:36,770
The product backlog needs to follow an Agile mindset,

55
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,790
which drives us to have a feature breakdown approach with a focus on

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,545
customer value streams based on the organization's strategic objectives.

57
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,190
Why it does not sound too dramatic?

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,930
I see a lot of organizations transitioning to Agile struggle with

59
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,010
the effort of moving from

60
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,140
a traditional business analysis mindset to having a customer centric approach,

61
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,530
where priorities are truly driven by the business.

62
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,460
This is where an empowered product owner plays a pivotal role.

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,770
Misconception number 5,

64
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,195
documentation audit trails for compliance are not important in Agile.

65
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,890
This has got to be one of

66
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,955
the most confusing and inaccurate misconceptions in the industry.

67
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,970
As a result, it causes a lot of concern to

68
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,535
leaders who are looking for important documentation to continue to exist.

69
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:31,460
While the Agile Manifesto states that Agile teams should provide

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,245
more emphasis on completed product results over comprehensive documentation,

71
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:40,825
this does not by any means equate to no documentation at all.

72
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:47,180
Adaptive planning in Agile Frameworks push Agile teams to do away with non-value

73
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,450
added or redundant documents and paper trails

74
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,175
that have been created over the years just to meet some requirement.

75
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:58,310
Agile teams are being asked to challenge themselves to truly

76
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,765
document what is valuable to maintain and sustain the product.

77
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:09,630
Again, the customer-centric and product-focused thought process is essential here.
