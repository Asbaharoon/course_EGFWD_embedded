1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,485
In this lesson, we talked about the value of Agile frameworks.

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:07,050
We discussed how an Agile framework takes

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,450
the abstract principles of the Agile Manifesto and gives it a practical shape.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,125
We then looked at the important characteristics of the Scrum framework,

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,020
which is by far the most common Agile framework

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,760
in use across various industries globally.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,450
We saw how the three Scrum principles of transparency, inspection,

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:34,685
and adaptation help Agile teams creatively manage the work with the focus on delivering

9
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:38,900
complex adaptive product features in an age wherein

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,970
customers expect rapid responses based on emerging market needs.

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,880
We proceeded to examine the important characteristics of

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,914
the Kanban framework with its original lean product development.

13
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:56,275
Kanban is a lightweight Agile framework with considerable flexibility.

14
00:00:56,275 --> 00:01:00,125
The final Agile framework we looked at was XP.

15
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,375
A powerful Agile framework with its roots in software development.

16
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,415
We discussed XP stringent and strong focus on

17
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:11,720
technical excellence and best practices in software development.

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,729
We finished up by talking about some of the challenges of adopting the XP framework.

19
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,825
In this lesson, I hope you saw how an agile framework

20
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:25,645
allows an organization to execute on Agile's lofty promise.

21
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:29,210
This is the promise of a truly unique flavor and

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,540
that Agile focuses on both delivering quality,

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,620
and value to the business in an adaptable manner.
