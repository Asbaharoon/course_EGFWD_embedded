1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,115
As you must have noticed,

2
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:07,245
XP has a much more stringent approach than many other Agile frameworks.

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:10,305
For example, as we discussed earlier,

4
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:15,570
Kanban is a much lighter framework with plenty of room for flexibility in the processes.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,420
None other practices in XP are

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,775
optional and the practices are very specific about how the work gets done.

7
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:27,890
XP again, is strongly oriented to software development.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,430
The XP framework has four core roles,

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,950
three of which are quite analogous to the three core roles in most Agile frameworks.

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,720
The first is the customer,

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,835
which is somewhat like the P0.

12
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:44,180
The customer is the business representatives.

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,325
The next role is the tester.

14
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:50,030
Testers are primarily responsible for quality assurance.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,605
Another role is that of the coach who acts as a mentor for the team.

16
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:58,040
The coach is also a facilitator for the team.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,750
Then we have programmers who are the developers who built a product.

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,855
Let's look at all four of these important roles.

19
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,680
A customer is a critical role in XP,

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,490
since the customer is responsible for working with the business to

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,470
prioritize and maximize the value of the product deliverables being worked on.

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,875
The customer is primarily responsible for prioritizing and managing the Product Backlog.

23
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:29,300
An XP team has a small number of programmers who work together and

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,505
collaborate in practicing XP core values like paired programming,

25
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:38,645
Test-driven development, as well as continuous Integration.

26
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:42,410
A high achieving XP team will include a designer,

27
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,890
one senior programmer, and an architect,

28
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,795
under the programmer role.

29
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:53,689
Programmers exhibit T-shaped skills by assisting with testing when time permits.

30
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,170
The XP coach is a servant leader and

31
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,025
plays a pivotal role supporting in the team's success.

32
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,950
XP has several detailed practices,

33
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,285
which the coach helps the team to learn and follow.

34
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:13,505
Testers partner with, and assist the customer in creating acceptance criteria,

35
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:21,005
execute test cases, and communicate the outcomes and feedback with the programmers.

36
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,110
All the XP ceremonies aligned with

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,290
the Scrum Framework ceremonies that we discussed earlier,

38
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,645
except the names are different.

39
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:33,065
In XP, they are Iteration Planning,

40
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:37,780
Iteration Review, and Iteration Retrospective.

41
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,850
The six XP ceremonies are virtually the

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,285
same as their counterparts ceremonies in the Scrum Framework.

43
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:45,980
As you can see here,

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,135
the project vision ceremony in Kanban has virtually the same purpose,

45
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:53,545
agenda, timing, and expected outcome.

46
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:57,155
The same can be said for the daily standup in XP,

47
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:01,135
as well as XP's Iteration Planning.

48
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:03,585
The Iteration Review and Demo,

49
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,750
in XP also follows the same format.

50
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,925
Iteration Retrospectives remain just as critical in XP as they are in Scrum,

51
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,960
Kanban, and other Agile frameworks.

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,644
The release planning session in XP is also the same as in other Agile frameworks.

53
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:25,415
Since XP is the most thorough Agile framework in terms of processes,

54
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:31,840
all the artifacts covered in the Scrum Framework and Kanban Framework are included in XP.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,060
Again, XP is considerably more structured in

56
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,400
the Scrum Framework and a lot more thorough than the lightweight Kanban framework.
