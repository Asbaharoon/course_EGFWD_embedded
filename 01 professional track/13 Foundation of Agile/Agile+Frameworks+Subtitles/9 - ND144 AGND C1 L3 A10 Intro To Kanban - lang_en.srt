1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Let us examine the important characteristics of the Kanban framework.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,740
Kanban has its origins in lean product development,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,440
an approach to product development inspired by

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,945
lean manufacturing principles and practices at Toyota.

5
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:17,550
Let us first delve into lean product development.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,845
Lean product development focuses on seven fundamental principles.

7
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:26,430
The lean principles of eliminate waste,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,405
build in quality, create knowledge,

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:34,520
defer commitment, deliver fast,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,154
respect people, and optimize the whole,

11
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:42,400
set the foundation for Kanban.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,225
To eliminate waste, it must be recognized and identified.

13
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,490
So what is waste exactly?

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,630
Waste is anything that does not add value to

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,385
the customer or anything that does not improve the quality,

16
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:01,100
and anything that unnecessarily increases

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,325
the amount of time or effort to produce the product.

18
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:08,600
Traditional product development focuses on finding defects.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,160
Lean focuses on good practices to ensure integrity and prevent defects.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:24,060
Lean encourages both training and peer-to-peer knowledge transfer to create knowledge.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,800
In Lean, iterative demo to the business users

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,645
allows the team to live through the concept of do a little,

23
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:35,320
show a little, learn a little.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,315
Collaboration enhances sharing of explicit and tacit knowledge.

25
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:47,180
Lean recommends the Agile team wait until the last responsible moment to make a decision.

26
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,630
The last responsible moment is that point

27
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,364
where if the Agile team does not make a decision,

28
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,950
you will either significantly impact the work

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,205
or a decision will be made by others for them.

30
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:04,370
The last responsible moment allows for the Agile team to

31
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,365
remain agile and to have some stretch of innovation.

32
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:15,170
Lean encourages the Agile team to create product incrementally where

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,635
the team builds only what is truly needed and avoids unnecessary features.

34
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:27,835
Lean recommends to release product earlier to get feedback from the customer sooner.

35
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:31,370
The Agile team needs to feel trusted and

36
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,990
valuable to be able to think and solve problems for themselves.

37
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,685
They need authority to effect outcomes.

38
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:43,955
Product development involves interdependencies with business partners,

39
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,695
customers, and IT departmental units.

40
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:52,700
Lean encourages decreasing barriers to increase efficiencies,

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,295
to decrease the amount of hand-offs,

42
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:57,485
and to decrease work-in-progress,

43
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,335
also known as WIP.

44
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,984
When lean principles are followed,

45
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:08,240
customer satisfaction and quality increases while the time to market is reduced.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,410
Kanban in Japanese refers to a signboard.

47
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,000
This Kanban board is instrumental in Kanban.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,820
An approach where the Agile team can visualize the workflow is

49
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,780
important since it helps in organizing,

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,820
tracking, and optimizing the work.

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,025
Kanban recommends establishing limits to the work the Agile team has in progress.

52
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:39,185
Kanban establishes and respects the team's ideal work capacity.

53
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:44,165
Limiting WIP helps to smooth the flow of work,

54
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:48,710
reduce lead times, improve quality,

55
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,405
and deliver more frequently.

56
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:56,300
By monitoring and measuring the flow of work through each work state,

57
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,330
issues are identified as soon as possible.

58
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,515
This helps to minimize lead times and improve delivery predictability.

59
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:10,100
Establishing policies that provides the Agile team with

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,615
explicit understanding of the processes has tremendous benefits.

61
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:18,650
Most importantly, discussions around issues

62
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,405
can take place in an objective rather than in an emotional manner.

63
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:29,045
The Agile team must own the team's work related processes

64
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:35,345
and work collaboratively to improve the processes being utilized.

65
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:39,365
A Kanban board plays a valuable role since it

66
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:45,570
articulates the work items in their various stages of the product development journey.
