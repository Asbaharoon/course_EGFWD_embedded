00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,965
Let us look at how seasoned Agilers, approach Agile frameworks.

2
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:07,740
As an Agile transformation expert,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,610
I envision these frameworks as the enablers that

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,300
bring to fruition the good intention of an organization's leaders,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,550
as well as Agile team members.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,790
It brings some comfort to everyone involved to follow

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,690
a prominent framework that has been tried and tested in the market.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,435
Agilers leverage a framework to deliver on some of the significant promises of Agile.

9
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:34,100
This includes, as the Agile Manifesto states,

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,720
focusing more on the individuals and interactions.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,430
The organization must bring to life the theoretical appreciation that

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,920
the most significant impact on the success of

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,655
an Agile team are the skilled team members themselves.

14
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:54,740
All Agile frameworks emphasize that the ultimate determining factor for

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,160
success of a product are the resources on the Agile Product Delivery team.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,700
How do we do this practically?

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,510
We have to recruit and retain the right skilled resources,

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,030
and cultivate a collaborative and value-driven environment

19
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,160
that elevates the human spirit,

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,040
to bring out the best in each resource for the collective benefit of all.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,374
While Agilers look at a proven track record of accomplishments when recruiting,

22
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:27,950
they also look at the right team-oriented mindset

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,485
and willingness to adapt to meet the business' emergent needs.

24
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:37,295
Such a recruit, who is a flexible and collaborative team player,

25
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,410
when given the right environment,

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,105
propels an Agile team forward in the right direction.

27
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:47,700
As they say, if it's working well, don't over-fix it.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,970
Leaders have to regularly be reminded that adopting Agile is supposed to improve

29
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,865
performance and deliver more value

30
00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:00,115
directed at the product and, ultimately, organizational vision.

31
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:04,865
Each of the Agile frameworks allows for some flexibility,

32
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,990
so it is important to not impose everything Agile

33
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,625
all at once on a team that's already performing well in delivering value.

34
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,300
In fact, high-performing teams are quite likely to

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,820
already be engaged in many Agile practices without even realizing it.

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,860
Such high-performing teams can be gradually introduced to additional Agile practices,

37
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,470
based on a specific Agile framework,

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,010
through retrospectives and other guided, continually improvement opportunities.

39
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,990
The potential of an Agile team only

40
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,705
grows when they are challenged to find opportunities for improvement.

41
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:48,305
The quality of the stories that are brought into the backlog is important.

42
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:51,560
Agilers work with product owners to ensure

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,990
the users' toys have been sufficiently refined for the Agile team to proceed.

44
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,540
Now, a PO has to be reminded that it is

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,625
not their job to zero in on a specific technical solution.

46
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,750
That is the Agile team's responsibility.

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,680
A PO who heavily intrudes into solutioning

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,180
will inhibit the Agile team's innovative drive.

49
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,750
Transforming teams into an Agile mindset is hard enough.

50
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,350
A lack of respect for the backlog's priorities and

51
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,275
realistic estimates can drive the Agile team and everyone else crazy.

52
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:29,780
Agilers focus on ensuring that the Agile team does

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,529
not over-commit to what can be accomplished in each iteration,

54
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:36,620
especially during the first few iterations.

55
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,280
A close eye must be kept on the product backlog board,

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,620
with the help of a regularly updated work tracking system such as JIRA, ADO, or Rally.

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,430
At the end of the day,

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,380
implementing a specific Agile framework is a fine balancing act.

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,154
Organizations must be willing to adapt,

60
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,820
based on each organization's unique culture and context.

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,615
Experts have to regularly remind both leaders and the Agile team

62
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:10,975
to remember that there is no one way to execute Agile practices in an organization.

63
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:13,950
Agile principles and practices are,

64
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,150
by their very nature,

65
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,280
to be adapted as needed.
