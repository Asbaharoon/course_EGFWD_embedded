00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,375
In this exercise, you are asked to identify key differences between Kanban and XP.

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:10,170
You are asked to cover the roles,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,730
the respective ceremonies, as well as the practices.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,115
Here are my responses.

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:21,810
The three core roles in the Kanban framework are the PO,

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,070
the facilitator, and the Agile team.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,680
Let's start with the facilitator role.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,169
This role is responsible for providing Kanban framework coaching and guidance,

9
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:39,450
facilitating the Agile teams work and protecting it from problems.

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,520
The facilitator is a servant leader to the PO and Agile team.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,765
The next core role in Kanban is the product owner.

12
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:53,870
The product owner is specifically known as the voice of the customer.

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,170
This is the one individual who is responsible for

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,915
the prioritized work item list called a product backlog.

15
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:07,070
The product owner shares business decisions in a timely manner and provides

16
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,760
any requirements or functionality related information

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,415
to the Agile team in a timely manner.

18
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:17,750
The next core role in Kanban is the Agile team member.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,110
This core role would primarily include developers,

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,055
who are responsible for the creation and delivery of a system.

21
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:29,585
However, all other Agile team members will also be included in this category.

22
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:32,810
This includes, but is not limited to,

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,485
those who will conduct modeling, programming,

24
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,590
testing, front end design,

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,850
business analysis, release activities, and others.

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,905
The XP framework has four core roles,

27
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:53,125
three of which are quite analogous to the Kanban roles that we just discussed.

28
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,100
The first is the customer,

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,395
which is somewhat like the PO.

30
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,289
The customer in XP,

31
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,560
is the business representative.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,510
The next core role in XP is the tester.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,535
Testers are primarily responsible for quality assurance.

34
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:15,700
This role does not explicitly exist as a separate role in Kanban.

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,285
Another role is that of the coach who acts as a mentor for the team.

36
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,425
Since the coach is also a facilitator for the team,

37
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:27,440
this is somewhat similar to the facilitator role in Kanban.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,600
Then we have programmers who are the developers who build the product.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,805
While not exactly the same,

40
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:39,790
this is most closely related to the Agile team member role in Kanban.

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,845
Let's look at all four of these important roles.

42
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:48,230
An XP team has a small number of programmers who work together and

43
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,585
collaborate in practicing XP core values like pair programming,

44
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,810
test-driven development, as well as continuous integration.

45
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,655
A high achieving XP team will include a designer,

46
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:06,475
one senior programmer, and an architect under the programmer role.

47
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:12,444
Programmers exhibit T-shaped skills by assisting with testing when time permits.

48
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:17,510
Testers partner with and assist the customer in creating acceptance criteria,

49
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,645
execute test cases, and communicate the outcomes in feedback with the programmers.

50
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:29,135
Again, this is a role that does not directly exist in Kanban.

51
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:36,020
The XP coach is a servant leader and plays a pivotal supporting role in the team success.

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,550
XP has several detailed practices which the coach helps the team to learn and follow.

53
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,260
A customer is a critical role in XP since the customers are responsible for

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,810
working with the business to prioritize and

55
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,580
maximize the value of the product deliverables being worked on.

56
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,275
The customer is primarily responsible for prioritizing and managing the product backlog.

57
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:06,335
Again, the customer is similar to the PO in the Kanban framework.

58
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:11,480
There are certain ceremonies in XP that do not need to take place in Kanban.

59
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,930
One is the iteration retrospective where there's

60
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,220
an opportunity for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements.

61
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,490
Team members discuss what went well during the iteration,

62
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,055
as well as opportunities for improvement.

63
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,100
The iteration retrospective occurs once per

64
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,860
iteration and is timebox to three hours per iteration.

65
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,465
The second is iteration planning,

66
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:39,125
where the work to be performed in the iteration is planned.

67
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,445
The agenda includes creating the iteration backlog,

68
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:45,605
planning out the tasks,

69
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,380
and estimating at a task level.

70
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,455
This can occur a few times per iteration,

71
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:56,050
but it's timebox in total to eight hours per iteration.

72
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,910
XP is considerably more stringent.

73
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,840
XP has 13 detailed practices,

74
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,340
whereas Kanban just focuses on flow and Work in Progress or WIP.
