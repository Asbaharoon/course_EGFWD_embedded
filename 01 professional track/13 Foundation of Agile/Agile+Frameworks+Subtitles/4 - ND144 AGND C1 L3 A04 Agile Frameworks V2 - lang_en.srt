1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,690
Agile has come to be an umbrella term for

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,995
a variety of frameworks that align with the agile manifesto.

3
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:12,795
The Agile Manifesto drives the Agile mindset shared

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:18,435
principles that are universal and encouraged across all the frameworks.

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,490
Under the Agile umbrella,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,245
at the heart of every Agile product development in a complex environment is that

7
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:31,395
one invincible idea that someone in the business thinks is a sure win for the market.

8
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:36,720
However, history has taught us that a product and its features need to be adjusted along

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,220
the way to genuinely become

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,480
that great invincible solution that the market will fall in love with.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,380
The.com bubble around the turn of the century taught us

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,750
the harsh lesson that if we're not willing

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,465
to be adaptable based on the pulse of the market,

14
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:54,460
our products can very quickly become irrelevant to end users.

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,795
Every Agile team's goal is to deliver value driven functionality with built-in quality.

16
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:02,690
There's the inspirational desire to deliver upon

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,440
that great idea that customers love and to do it quick.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,230
So how should Agile teams deliver both amazing product features that delight customers,

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,335
as well as do it fast?

20
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:18,290
One way to make this happen is to quickly change course when it is

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,025
realized that a product feature is heading down the wrong path.

22
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:26,635
That is what the Agile world refers to as failing fast and learning.

23
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:29,205
With a limited amount of resources,

24
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,490
the longer it takes for an organization to

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,655
realize that a particular idea is not a true winner,

26
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:37,030
the more resources are wasted.

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,120
The significant advantage of failing fast is that if

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,245
a customer does not provide positive feedback for functionality being built,

29
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,560
the Agile team can quickly readjust

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,415
their priorities and focus on other more important items.

31
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:54,410
Enlightened and directed trial and error is what

32
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,565
the growth mindset promotes when it comes to fail fast and learn.

33
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:04,375
An absolutely key driver behind anything Agile is to deliver value.

34
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,835
Each Agile Framework, which we will be discussing,

35
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:11,945
is driven by the goal of delivering maximum business value.

36
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:15,620
It is aligned with the organization's vision.

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,500
A continual improvement process,

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,340
also often called a continuous improvement process,

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,360
is an ongoing effort to challenge everyone involved

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,790
to improve the product features or processes being used to deliver the product.

41
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,745
Agile promotes incremental improvement to minimize resistance from all who were involved.

42
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:42,820
Ultimately, flexibility is one of the foundations of any Agile framework.

43
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,430
Identifying opportunities for flexibility in

44
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,670
the processes and the adaptive planning that Agile frameworks

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,270
promote allows the Agile team to adapt to changes

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,410
and still have the strong capability to deliver a valuable product.

47
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,430
Agile frameworks promote trust and respect because

48
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,660
such trust and respect motivates Agile teams.

49
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,920
All the framework state that Agile team strive to deliver what they have committed to.

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,520
In fact, trust and respect are really the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,255
All Agile frameworks encourage Agile teams to cultivate mastery.

52
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:28,010
In Agile teams, time is put aside for learning and growth.

53
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,885
This allows Agile team members to sharpen their skills.

54
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:35,300
This built-in structure to hone their skills,

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,835
further motivates the Agile team and additional valuable results are produced.

56
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:47,710
This mindset of continual improvement is built-in alongside built-in quality.

57
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,775
Under the Agile umbrella,

58
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:54,485
there are large number of ever-growing frameworks some are listed here.

59
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:59,430
They include the ones identified here, plus many others.
