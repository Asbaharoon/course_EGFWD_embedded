00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
In this exercise, you are asked to select and recommend

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,300
a particular Agile Framework for

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,145
socialkare.gov taking into account their specific scenario.

4
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,095
You are asked to include

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:18,330
a specific characteristic of the project that makes sense for this Agile Framework,

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,870
as well as an explanation or justification for it.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,235
Here my responses, I recommend socialkare.gov to consider adopting the Scrum Framework.

8
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:33,240
There is a need for time-boxed iterations or sprints,

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,700
and the justification is that socialkare.gov is a complex project,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,270
and time-boxed sprints will allow for regular demos and proactive feedback from

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,310
the business to ensure that

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,075
the project and the product deliverables are heading in the right direction.

13
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:54,115
This was missing and caused a lot of issues.

14
00:00:54,115 --> 00:01:00,440
There is a need for and tremendous benefit with Retrospectives.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,520
Sprint Retrospectives will ensure the Agile team at socialkare.gov is working towards

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,760
guided continual improvement to help

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,534
such a complex project successfully delivered the anticipated business value.

18
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,030
Otherwise, the danger of losing the focus on

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,790
business value is eminent in such an intertwined project.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,009
Socialkare.gov has a need for self-directed and self-organized teams.

21
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,450
Now, the Scrum Framework insists on the Agile team being given

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,365
autonomy to work on the prioritized and assigned features and functionality.

23
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:43,390
This will allow the Agile team to innovatively identify

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,560
solution details without the burden of excessive micromanagement.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,580
Kanban does not provide sufficient rigor to manage such a complex project,

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,045
and XP will be a bit of overkill for a project like socialkare.gov.

27
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:04,450
The transformation to XP requires considerably more rigor in structure,

28
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,830
and XP is too software centric and heavy for socialkare.gov.
