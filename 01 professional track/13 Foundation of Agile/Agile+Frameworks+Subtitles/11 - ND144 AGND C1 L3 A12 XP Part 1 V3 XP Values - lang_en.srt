00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
Let's look at the important characteristics of the XP framework.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,090
Extreme programming, which is routinely referred to XP is in the industry,

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,085
is a powerful Agile framework with its roots in software development.

4
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:20,685
XP has a strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.

5
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,150
Now, let's look at the XP core values.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,880
There are five XP core values.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,715
They are; simplicity, communication,

8
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:37,190
feedback, courage, and respect.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,285
Let's discuss each one of these XP core values.

10
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:46,910
XP encourages reducing unnecessary complexity when building a solution.

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,140
Minimizing extra features is also encouraged in XP since it

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,485
reduces waste and maximizes value for the investment.

13
00:00:56,485 --> 00:01:03,925
Simplicity, just like all the XP core values stems from the Agile manifesto.

14
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:06,425
In an XP environment,

15
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:09,350
all the team members have transparency in being aware of

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,425
what is expected of them in terms of deliverables,

17
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:17,390
as well as being aware of what others in the team are contributing towards.

18
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,430
A reliable avenue for keeping everyone informed is the daily stand-up,

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,630
which is a pivotal communication tool in XP.

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,825
Feedback in every iteration is taken seriously in XP,

21
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:34,535
with an opportunity to demonstrate working results early and often.

22
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:40,435
Failing fast allows the team to make changes proactively to improve the product.

23
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:45,560
Courage, allows a team to bravely tell the truth about progress,

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,310
estimates and any impediments to value delivery.

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,605
Paired programming and XP core practice that will be explained shortly,

26
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:58,595
requires that courage of paired team members to share code

27
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:04,085
and valiantly adapt to adhere to shared coding standards.

28
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:09,535
Respect is a key foundational element in XP for a high-achieving team.

29
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:15,200
In XP, each team member is accountable for a successful product delivery,

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,290
which requires giving everyone respect to

31
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,265
accomplish their own tasks while working collaboratively.

32
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:26,110
Respect is practiced in pair programming as well,

33
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,720
where paired team members respect their differences.
