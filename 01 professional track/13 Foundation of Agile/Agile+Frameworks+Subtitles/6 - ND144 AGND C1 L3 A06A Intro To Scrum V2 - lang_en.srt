00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Let us look at the important characteristics of the Scrum framework.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,595
Scrum is by far the most common Agile framework in use across industries globally.

3
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:18,180
In Scrum, the Agile team creatively manages the work with a focus on delivering

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,990
complex adaptive product features in an age when

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,000
customers expect rapid responses based on emerging market needs.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,184
The features are delivered iterations known as sprints,

7
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:33,930
without compromising on quality.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,765
In fact, quality is built into the Scrum framework.

9
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:44,995
Scrum prescribes a model in which a self-directed and self-organized Agile team,

10
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:49,495
plans their work themselves in a decentralized manner.

11
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:52,384
The Agile team conducts daily standups

12
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,265
in which they provide updates to each other every day.

13
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:58,850
They deliver in short sprints and they identify

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,355
opportunities for improvement through retrospectives at the end of each sprint.

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:09,230
The Scrum framework introduces specific roles with recommended responsibilities.

16
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:16,375
Scrum also introduces ceremonies with the recommended agenda, duration and frequency.

17
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:20,825
Several the Agile artifacts are regularly used in scrum.

18
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:23,320
We will look at them in a few minutes.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,315
Now, let us look at scrums pillars and values.

20
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:33,250
Scrum is based on three pillars and five fundamental values.

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,365
Transparency in scrum refers to explicitly giving visibility to all involved,

22
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,135
such as the business users,

23
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,405
the organization's leadership, the product owner,

24
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,020
as well as the Agile team itself.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,030
In order for transparency to work effectively,

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,330
scrum recommends that significant aspects of the product of

27
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,295
the reprocess should be defined by a common standard.

28
00:01:57,295 --> 00:02:02,945
This will help everyone in having a consistent understanding of what is being observed.

29
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:06,350
Such transparency builds trust and openness,

30
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,965
both within the Agile team as well as with those stakeholders outside the Agile team.

31
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,160
Inspection involves the business users or

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,850
their representatives reviewing the Agile teams progress

33
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,385
towards the defined goals and objectives.

34
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,025
This needs to be done with some frequency,

35
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,710
with the recommendation being that's such an inspection

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,650
should take place at least once per sprint,

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,810
but not so frequently that it slows the Agile teams progress.

38
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,629
This helps with quickly identifying any unwanted variances from the defined sprint goals.

39
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,650
With adaptation, scrum encourages Agile teams to

40
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,610
adjust and adapt based on opportunities for improvement

41
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,130
that are identified either by the Agile team

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,905
themselves or through feedback from others outside the Agile team.

43
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:01,730
Adjustments could include process improvements if it appears that

44
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,840
the existing process will negatively impact the final product deliverables.

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,230
Such adjustments should be proactively

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,950
dealt with to reduce further divergence from the goals.
