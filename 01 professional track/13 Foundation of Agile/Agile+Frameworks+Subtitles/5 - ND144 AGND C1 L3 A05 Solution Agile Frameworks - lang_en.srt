1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
In this exercise, you are asked to identify three benefits of using

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,490
an Agile framework and explain how

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,150
those benefits will help SocialKare.gov achieve its goals.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,505
Let's look at my response.

5
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,990
Each Agile framework has grown out of the real life experiences of

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,360
professionals who did not want to be

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,560
limited by the challenges of the traditional waterfall approach.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,900
So SocialKare.gov would benefit from the years of experience that

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,420
a proven framework has been built upon and further

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,300
refined over time at many organizations globally.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,025
Such real life experiences will help

12
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:44,765
SocialKare.gov learn from the mistakes made by other Agile teams,

13
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,730
such as launching a feature without getting proper user input.

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,390
By using a proven framework,

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,055
there's a higher level of predictability for the organization.

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,735
For example, SocialKare.gov leadership and Agile team

17
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:04,430
both will benefit from defined ceremonies and defined roles for

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,720
the Agile team that make it easier to go through an Agile transformation

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,350
knowing that this has been tried and has worked for other organizations.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,090
By adopting a proven Agile framework and its associated practices,

21
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,585
organizations benefit from higher quality product delivery.

22
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:29,750
SocialKare.gov will be able to deliver solutions in a timely manner with

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,800
a significantly higher level of end user satisfaction

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,685
because Agile Frameworks have quality built into each product deliverable iteration.

25
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:42,830
This prevents expensive delays due to

26
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,540
defects and rework at the end of the development cycle.

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,560
Another key benefit of any Agile framework is that it allows for customizing,

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,105
adapting the framework to better align with the organization.

29
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,395
Much like any organization,

30
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:02,840
the unique nature of SocialKare.gov product development environment will tend to lead to

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,725
some tailoring to better fit SocialKare.gov specific processes.

32
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:13,250
This refinement is best done once SocialKare.gov has tried out

33
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,395
an Agile Framework in its original form for awhile and learn from it.

34
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,420
That was my solution.

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,520
How does your answer differ from mine?
