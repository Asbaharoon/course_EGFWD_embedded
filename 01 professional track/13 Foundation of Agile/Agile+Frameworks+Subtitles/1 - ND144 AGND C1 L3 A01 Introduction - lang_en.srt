1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Nice to see you again.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,335
This lesson takes a deep dive into Agile frameworks.

3
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:07,930
It begins with an introduction to Agile frameworks in

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,680
general and what the benefits are of an Agile framework.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,010
This includes coverage of the shared characteristics of

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,794
Agile frameworks and reasons why adopting an agile framework makes sense.

7
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:23,530
We then look at Scrum as a framework and how Scrum

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,320
can be advantageous to when trying to balance priorities.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,635
Once you get familiar with Scrum,

10
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:31,450
you will be able to deliver value with

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,900
flexibility and patience in a collaborative manner.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,710
This lesson then goes into Kanban as a framework and it's

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,855
unique advantage in managing flow and work in progress or WIP.

14
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:46,730
Finally, a third discussion on XP and its advantages will

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,940
follow with an appreciation for its best practices around technical excellence.

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,855
By the end of this lesson,

17
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:58,445
you will be able to identify the advantages of using a framework,

18
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:02,435
identify the specific and shared characteristics of Scrum,

19
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:05,320
Kanban and the XP frameworks.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,510
You will also be able to determine which frameworks are appropriate for a given project,

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,935
identify the core team roles,

22
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:15,510
and assign team members to each role,

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,875
as well as implement best practices for each framework,

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,755
including ceremonies and artifacts.

25
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:24,210
Let's get going.
