1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
Now, let's look at the Scrum values.

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:06,510
There are five Scrum values.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,470
They are, focus, courage,

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,000
openness, commitment, and respect.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,615
Let's discuss each one of these Scrum values.

6
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:24,480
Delivering product features and results is a collaborative effort in Scrum,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,290
that requires everyone to focus on

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,205
the work to be completed in order to deliver the sprint goals.

9
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:39,435
Focus. Much like all the Scrum values is derived in Scrum from the Agile manifesto.

10
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:44,450
In Scrum, members of the Agile team need to have courage to

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,420
do what is right to ensure that the sprint goals are met.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,510
This may include having the courage to dig deep into

13
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,410
challenging problems being encountered and work through them.

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,430
Openness is key to Agile team performance.

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,690
The Scrum team and stakeholders agree to a culture of openness.

16
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,414
This ensures everyone will be comfortable to openly discuss all the work underway,

17
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:17,295
as well as any obstacles and challenges they may arise.

18
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:22,070
Commitments, build trust within the Agile team members,

19
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,035
and perhaps more importantly with the business users and leaders of the organization.

20
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:32,165
Scrum encourages the Agile team to have a reasonable good faith approach

21
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,430
to negotiating the sprint goals and

22
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,685
sincerely strive to attain the committed sprint goals.

23
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:41,975
Essentially, every Agile team member in Scrum,

24
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:45,365
personally committed to accomplishing the goals.

25
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:51,950
Respect is a key foundational element in Scrum for a high achieving Agile team.

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,520
The Scrum framework states that respect elevates

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,970
the Agile team members participation by including them

28
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,795
in ceremonies and all key planning components.

29
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:06,250
This increases the Agile teams motivation.

30
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,485
So does Scrum makes sense with all projects?

31
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,065
The answer is a clear no.

32
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:16,670
We discussed the Stacey diagram in an earlier lesson.

33
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,189
As the Stacey diagram shows,

34
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,430
an Agile framework like Scrum works best with

35
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,050
complex and complicated projects and products.

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,550
When there is near certainty on both the requirements and process upfront,

37
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,160
then there may not be as much value in utilizing Agile principles.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,385
Scrum is also not a magical solution for chaos.

39
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:45,020
That is, Scrum cannot miraculously bring value to an environment,

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,355
where there's no vision and no clear roadmap.

41
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:52,820
Again, Scrum also does not really make a lot of sense for

42
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,510
simple predictable projects and products where the need

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,260
for iterative learning and adapting is of no value.
