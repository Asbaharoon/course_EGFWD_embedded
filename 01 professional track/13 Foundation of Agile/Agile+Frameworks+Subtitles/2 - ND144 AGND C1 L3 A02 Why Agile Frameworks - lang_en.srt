1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
Agile is taking the product delivery market by storm.

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:05,895
Its principles relate to simplicity,

3
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:10,770
adaptability, and the ability to embrace change has a wonderful oeuvre.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,180
Yet for Agile to practically be utilized effectively,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,830
it is highly recommended that

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,230
a particular Agile framework or combination of frameworks be adopted.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,960
The guidance from these Agile frameworks are based on

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,200
several years of successful implementation in

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,040
numerous organizations around the globe who have successfully delivered

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,460
complex and adaptive product results within defined constraints.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,410
A lot of the lessons learned from these experiences have been

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,860
documented into best practices in guides,

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,335
books, and websites compiled by leading experts on specific frameworks.

14
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:50,660
From a resourcing perspective,

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,120
organizations are able to attract specific expertise from skilled agilists in

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,410
the market who have

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,704
a particularly strong background and passion for one of the specific frameworks.

18
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:06,740
Several renowned global Agile in industry bodies,

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,000
such as the Project Management Institute or Scaled Agile,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,060
regularly publish case studies outlining in

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,560
detail the successful implementation of a specific framework.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,120
This allows Agile transformation consultants and leaders to learn

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,725
from the experiences of other organization's Agile transformation journey.

24
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:30,830
They all adhere to the Agile mindset as being

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,995
fundamental to the success of any Agile journey.

26
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:41,975
Again, an Agile mindset is a set of attitudes supporting an Agile working environment.

27
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:44,660
When we talk about an Agile mindset,

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,060
we include respect, collaboration, continuous improvement,

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,335
iterative learning cycles, mastery and ownership,

30
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:56,660
focusing on delivering value,

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,494
and adaptability to change.

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,845
While all Agile frameworks outline how to do Agile,

33
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:09,995
they emphasize that being Agile is a key foundation to successfully doing Agile.

34
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:13,280
Some organizations in Agile teams unfortunately,

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,600
just focus on doing Agile.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,720
This equates to simply adopting

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,480
the Agile framework's practices without

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,155
committing to a exhibiting Agile principles and values.

39
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:27,785
The Agile manifesto's four paired core values

40
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:31,250
and its associated 12 guiding principles set

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,060
a solid foundation for the various Agile frameworks that are currently being

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,350
practiced by successful organizations in today's digital age.

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,250
Again, as agilists, we regularly have to remind

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,740
Agile organizations of the core roles and their responsibilities.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,810
With the product owner being the voice of the customer and product champion,

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,585
the facilitator as a servant leader,

47
00:02:56,585 --> 00:03:00,700
ensures the team functions as smoothly as possible.

48
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,880
The close-knit Agile team is responsible for determining

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,395
how to get the work done that the product owner has prioritized.

50
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:12,680
When I interact with those who are new to Agile,

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,169
it's a little hard for them to initially comprehend

52
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,155
the abstract principles of the Agile Manifesto.

53
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:23,075
This is where the various Agile practice oriented frameworks step in.

54
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:26,300
They provide particular guidance on how to bring

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,440
the Agile Manifesto's core values and principles to life.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,590
A framework allows an organization to execute an Agile's promise of

57
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,355
a truly unique flavor and that it focuses on delivering

58
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:46,410
both quality and value to the business in an adaptable manner.
