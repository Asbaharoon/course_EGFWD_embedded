1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
In order to minimize wasting time in unnecessary meetings and group discussions,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,510
the Kanban framework recommends focused meetings with a specific purpose.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,430
You remember the six Scrum ceremonies, right?

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,940
In Kanban, the ceremonies are simplified.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,910
There is no sprint planning ceremony,

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,745
and there is no sprint retrospective,

7
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:28,305
and the sprint review or demo is just called a review or demo,

8
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:33,790
so the four Kanban ceremonies align with four of the Scrum ceremonies.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,840
The four Kanban ceremonies are virtually the

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,140
same as their counterpart ceremonies in the Scrum framework.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,885
As you can see here,

12
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:46,325
the project vision ceremony in Kanban has virtually the same purpose,

13
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:50,885
agenda, timing, as well as expected outcome.

14
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,200
The same can be said for the daily stand up,

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,690
as well as the review or demo,

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,015
and the same also goes for release planning.

17
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:04,700
Kanban provides the ability to view in one instance,

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,805
the status of the entire product development journey.

19
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:12,170
The Kanban board makes it very easy to visualize what has been completed,

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,435
what is currently in progress,

21
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:17,900
and what work items have not commenced yet.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,369
Since it focuses on the Agile team's workflow and throughput,

23
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:27,830
Kanban is seen as a better Agile Framework option solution for projects where

24
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,550
the work is likely to involve a large quantity of relatively small activities.

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,765
Kanban is also suitable for work that may arise on an ad-hoc basis.

26
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,250
Now, let us discuss Kanban roles and artifacts.

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,020
Much like the various Agile Frameworks,

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,030
there are three core roles in the Kanban framework as well.

29
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,760
The first is a product owner or PO,

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,240
who is seen as the voice of the customer,

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,275
the next key role is that of the facilitator,

32
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,885
and then we have the Agile team.

33
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:04,160
Let's look at all three of these important roles.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,475
Kanban has a much more flexible approach,

35
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:14,645
but two key recommended artifacts are the Kanban board and cumulative flow diagram.

36
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:19,190
A Kanban board plays a valuable role since it

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,795
articulates the work items in the various stages of the product developing journey.

38
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,540
With a cumulative flow diagram,

39
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,330
problem areas are easily detected,

40
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,760
changes could be made so that work can continue efficiently,

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,660
and accumulative flow diagram also shows the total amount

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,370
of WIP or work in process and how quickly projects are being completed.
