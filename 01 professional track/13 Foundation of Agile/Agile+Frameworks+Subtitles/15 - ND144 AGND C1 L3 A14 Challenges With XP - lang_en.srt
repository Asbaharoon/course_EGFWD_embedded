00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
A number of organizations, particularly software-centric entities,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,400
get excited when they read that XP brings in

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,775
rigor alongside the typical benefits of Agile,

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,925
such as visibility, transparency,

5
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:18,330
and genuine collaboration towards value and delivery.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,720
Yet, I have seen many organizations struggle and get extremely frustrated with XP.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,900
Let's walk through some of the challenges of XP.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,105
XP places a lot of emphasis on software development practices.

9
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:34,770
This is different from

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,035
many other Agile Frameworks in which the emphasis is more on streamlining processes.

11
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,880
Traditional project managers are able to transition into

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,585
other frameworks like Scrum more comfortably,

13
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:51,565
since it feels like a leaner version of project management.

14
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:55,760
In XP, a traditional project manager might be

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,845
required to have a comfort level with stringent software-centric processes.

16
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:05,780
Recruiting experienced XP coaches is a challenge.

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,390
XP coaches are expected to be familiar with intricate details of software development,

18
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,630
as well as have the right personality and temperament to

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,500
facilitate ceremonies and difficult conversations.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,180
Such a combination of skills is both rare and expensive.

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,025
It is a lot easier to recruit for a Scrum master role in the Scrum Framework.

22
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,900
XP is indeed complex to implement.

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,755
So it can feel anti-Agile to some organizations and their leaders.

24
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:43,835
It takes some patience and discipline to both develop and maintain a successful XP team.

25
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:47,555
For example, practices like pair programming,

26
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:53,945
continuous integration, and test-driven development are not the easiest to adapt to.

27
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:57,230
With 13 defined practices,

28
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,715
XP has considerably more practices in many other Agile Frameworks.

29
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:07,295
Organizations who are thinking of adopting XP need experienced coaches,

30
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:10,760
a willing and highly skilled team of programmers,

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,250
and leaders who have the resilience to

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,490
guide the organization through the initial turbulence.

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,400
This will ensure everyone will work together to

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,070
align with the organization's vision and mission.
