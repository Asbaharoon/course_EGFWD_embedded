1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Welcome to foundations of Agile and Agile frameworks.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,220
My name is Dr. Hasnain Rizvi,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,825
and I will be your instructor.

4
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:08,940
I am delighted to have you on board.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,745
A little introduction about myself.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:17,325
Like many agilelists, I started my career in traditional project management.

7
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:23,445
My first foray into Agile was in southern California back in early 2011.

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:26,864
Coming from a traditional project management mindset,

9
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,250
I initially thought Agile frameworks were a little

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,165
impractical for large projects in old school organizations.

11
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:38,255
I have since been proven wrong many a times.

12
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:43,055
I've had the good fortune of growing in the Agile space over the last decade.

13
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:47,420
I've been involved in complex Agile transformations across the globe,

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,715
including North America, the Middle East, Europe, and China.

15
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm currently consulting as

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,930
an Agile transformation coach for a Fortune 100 company in America.

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,820
I love to teach,

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,620
and I'm an adjunct instructor and

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,220
professional trainer with several universities and organizations,

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,770
including the University of British Columbia,

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,500
Southern Alberta Institute of Technology,

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,250
Steinbeis School of International Business and Entrepreneurship,

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,615
as well as Leoron Professional Development Institute.

24
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:24,675
I have trained and mentored over 25,000 professionals across the globe.

25
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,900
I'm regularly invited to speak on

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
key Agile topics at professional events in North America,

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,610
Europe, and the Middle East.

28
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,400
Finally, I have a doctorate in Project and Program

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,234
Management from SKEMA Business School in France,

30
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:41,510
where my research was focused on Agile project management.

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,329
Again, welcome aboard, and I wish you all the best in this exciting course.
