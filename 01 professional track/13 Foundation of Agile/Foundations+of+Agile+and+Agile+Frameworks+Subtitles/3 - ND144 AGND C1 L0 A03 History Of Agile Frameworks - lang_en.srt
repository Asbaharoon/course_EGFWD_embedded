1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Much like other paradigm shifts in the business world,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,800
Agile came into existence based on a business need.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,390
Agile emerged almost organically as a result of a market

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,415
need to deal with the crisis product development faced in the 1990s.

5
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,560
Back in the 1990s,

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,790
it was taking somewhere in the range of two to four years to get

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,190
a software solution to production from

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,730
the time it was conceived as a valuable business need.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,195
This delay was just not acceptable for enterprise business users.

10
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:38,960
The market had started to evolve and it was beginning to be realized that

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,320
both the needs and expectations from

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,225
the business users would not remain static for 2-4 years.

13
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:50,165
Change was inevitable before the product made it to market,

14
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:54,895
which was difficult to maneuver with the traditional product development models.

15
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:59,900
A growing number of experts felt that there had to be a better way to build

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,320
products with a focus on business users and business value.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,085
In the spring of 2000,

18
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:13,010
a group of industry experts gathered in

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,170
Oregon to come up with some common ground on how to move forward.

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,270
This meeting would eventually lead to a famous gathering in Utah over a long weekend in

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:32,525
February 2001 where 17 thought leaders finalized and formalized the Agile Manifesto.

22
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,870
This historic meeting paved the way for

23
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,609
a common base for all Agile frameworks going forward.

24
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,305
We'll talk more about the Agile framework in the next lesson.

25
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:50,180
But for now, you should be aware that these 17 experts sought ways to

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,785
quickly build working solutions and get it into the hands of end-users.

27
00:01:56,785 --> 00:02:02,480
This fast delivery approach provided a couple of important benefits.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,095
First, it enabled users to get some of the business benefits of the new solution quicker.

29
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:14,360
Second, it enabled the product development team to get rapid feedback on the solution.

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,930
Because Agile was developed for software development,

31
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,585
a lot of people think that software is the only place where Agile is valuable.

32
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,005
This is far from the truth.

33
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:30,575
Today, Agile principles are being applied in all industries across the globe.

34
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,140
In the revolutionary world of Agile,

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,870
if your processes are not continually being

36
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,215
challenged to deliver additional business value,

37
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:42,130
you are an outdated organization.

38
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,420
As we will discuss in this course,

39
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,660
that razor sharp focus on business value is the secret to Agile's miraculous success.
