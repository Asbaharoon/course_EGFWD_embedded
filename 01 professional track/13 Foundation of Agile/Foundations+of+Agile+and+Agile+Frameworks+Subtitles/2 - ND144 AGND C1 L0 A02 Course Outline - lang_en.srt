1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
We will start off with discussing why Agile has taken today's digital economy by storm.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,230
We will focus on the Agile mindset and how it sets the tone

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,100
for being Agile versus just doing Agile.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,720
The Agile Manifesto and how it is seen as the foundational set of

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,060
four-paired core values and

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,785
12 principles that sets the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

7
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:29,100
We will wrap up the "Why Agile" lesson with

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,284
an important discussion on Agile versus Waterfall approaches.

9
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:36,030
This will explore where it makes more sense for

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,700
an Agile approach and where we are better off taking a more Waterfall approach.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,485
We will then build upon the foundational principles of Agile,

12
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:48,740
and take a deep dive into Agile teams

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,025
and their ability to deliver immense business value.

14
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:55,385
Here, we will cover the key topics of

15
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:59,500
the key characteristics of high performing Agile teams.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,985
The three core roles that are generally seen as universal across Agile frameworks.

17
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,870
We will also cover the size, structure,

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:14,465
and cross-functional or T-shaped skills in an Agile team.

19
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:19,550
We will cover best practices based on guidance from global experts.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,805
Finally, we will conclude the lesson with a discussion on Agile governance.

21
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:26,810
This will include the importance of

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,920
non-core roles to the success of Agile product delivery.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,740
We will also cover centralized versus decentralized decision-making.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,210
The last lesson will cover Agile frameworks.

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,220
We will begin with an overview of Agile frameworks in general,

26
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,080
and how each of them leveraged

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,609
the Agile manifesto four-paired core values and 12 principles.

28
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,950
We will see how Agile frameworks are

29
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,795
the practical vehicle for enabling Agile and successful teams.

30
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:59,750
After this, we will cover three of

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,980
the more popular Agile frameworks being utilized across all industries.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,800
We will first discuss the Scrum Framework,

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,090
and the benefits organizations gain when adopting Scrum.

34
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,405
We will then move on to Kanban,

35
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,770
one of the more lightweight frameworks,

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,709
and discuss its key characteristics and benefits.

37
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:23,390
We will discuss where it makes sense for Kanban to be incorporated into the workflow.

38
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,464
Finally, we will cover extreme programming,

39
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:29,675
which is typically called XP in the industry.

40
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,510
We will go over XP's core values and

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,255
strict practices along with explaining where XP should be used.

42
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:39,230
By the end of this course,

43
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,280
you will be able to identify and apply the characteristics of

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,340
Agile to implement value-driven delivery in these dramatically uncertain times.

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,130
Determine the appropriate Agile framework for

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,990
a specific business use case and Agile team.

47
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,525
Apply appropriate Agile practices for the specific Agile framework being used.

48
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:06,020
This will allow us to see how the conceptual values and

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,255
principles of the Agile Manifesto are practically implemented.

50
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:14,330
Build and evolve a high-performing Agile team.

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,040
We will understand how such high performing Agile teams become a source

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,050
of spectacular endurance for organizations with a growth mindset.

53
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,525
Differentiate between team roles and responsibilities of a typical Agile team,

54
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:34,040
and assign team members to an appropriate role.

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,110
By the end of this course,

56
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,420
you'll be familiar with many terms like the ones listed here, plus many more.
