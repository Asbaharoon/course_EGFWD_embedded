System Constraints
------------------

1- Frequency used : 	must be exactly 1 MHZ (internal RC oscillator), 
	            	if to use another exteranl Oscillator then it should be 1 MHZ
 			otherwise, the code must be edited accroding to the external new Oscillator value

2- pins 	  :	*pulling up* any one of the led pins will lead to undefined behaviour, 
			*pulling up or down* the button pins will lead to undefined behaviour, 
			the vcc shall be connected to 5V not less nor more than that
			the resistor connected to any one of the leds shall make the current source of any
			one of led pins not more than 40 mA and the anode of the led is connected to pin not the cathode
			one of the terminals of the button to be connected to the EXT0 pin and the other terminal to ground
			no need to any external pull up or down resistors as I am using the internal pull up

3- environment	  :	the environment that this MCU is put in shallnot be in a Mechanical Noisy environment
			as the inernal Oscillator is being used which is affected by any mechanincal movements

4- reset	  :	the reset pin should be connected to 5V as if not it may make the MCU go reset upon any noise
			on this pin as causing the MCU while operating can lead to Car accidents.
