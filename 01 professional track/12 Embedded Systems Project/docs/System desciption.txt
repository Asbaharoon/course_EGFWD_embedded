System Description
------------------

- the system is operating as a traffic leds controller where it has 2 operating modes:

1) Normal mode: the cars are allowed to move when the leds are green or yellow and at this time 
   the padestrians can't cross the road, but when the cars led turn red then the padestrian green led is on 
   meaning that the padestrian can cross the road, and the system goes on like:
	
cars green led on -> cars yellow led blink -> cars red led on     -> cars yellow led blink -> cars green led on
people red led on -> people red led on 	   -> people green led on -> people red led on     -> people red led on 


2) padestrian mode: happens when some people press on the button in order to cross the road making the MCU take 
   some squence to make the cars stop allowing the padestrians to move

and it has 2 conditions:

a- the cars green led was active when the button was pressed

cars green led on -> cars yellow led blink   -> cars red led on     -> cars yellow led blink   -> cars green led on
people red led on -> people Yellow led blink -> people green led on -> people Yellow led blink -> people red led on 

then back to normal mode

b- the cars red led was active when the button was pressed

-> cars red led on  -> cars yellow led blink   -> cars green led on
people green led on -> people Yellow led blink -> people red led on 

then back to normal mode
