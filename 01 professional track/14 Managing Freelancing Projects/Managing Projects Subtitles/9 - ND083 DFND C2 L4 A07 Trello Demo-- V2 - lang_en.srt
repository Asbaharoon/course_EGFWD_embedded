00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,105
Now to dig in to one specific tool,

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:07,755
I'll hand over to my colleague Yasmin to introduce us to Trello.

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:10,290
Thanks [inaudible]. Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,110
We're going to go through how to make a Trello board

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,290
and look at the different organizational features it offers.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,200
Trello is really useful when you're working with

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,870
more than one other person on a project because

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,250
it allows a clear way to

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,810
both assigned tasks and communicate the task status to the whole group.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,430
You can create what we call boards for specific projects in Trello.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,295
For example, you could create a board named

12
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,620
Wordpress Website Development to

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,440
track all the development tasks of that project in the board.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,585
First, we're going to go ahead and select "Create new board" down here,

15
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,565
and let's add a name to that board.

16
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:58,720
Let's use the example that we said before, Wordpress Website Development.

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,800
We could go ahead and change it to different colors and different themes,

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,255
so I'm going to go ahead and select blue,

19
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,950
and then we're going to hit "Create board".

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,795
Awesome. So here is our blank Trello board.

21
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:19,910
To organize the tasks in the specific phases of the project,

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,995
we can use something called a list.

23
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:27,425
A list could have all the information about tasks in a specific phase of a project.

24
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:30,830
For example, let's go ahead and create three lists.

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,260
One of them can be called To Do,

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,555
another one can be To be Approved,

27
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:45,315
and then finally, we'll say Approved by Client.

28
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:48,690
Your lists don't have to look like this.

29
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,740
They don't have to be To Do,

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,090
To be Approved, Approved by Client.

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,855
We're just doing this for the sake of the demo.

32
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:56,945
We have our three lists here,

33
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:04,355
and we want to add the different tasks or activities. It's called cards.

34
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,680
These cards are just like post-it notes that you

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,020
can move across the list as a project moves on.

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,795
Let's say you completed something in the To-Do list.

37
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,570
You can drag the card over To be Approved,

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,650
and then Approved once it's approved by the client.

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,840
Let's go ahead, and in our to-do list,

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,985
we'll add a card called Create Sign in form.

41
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:29,490
We'll also add another card,

42
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,029
Add Forgot Password page,

43
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:38,470
and then Enable Search Functionality.

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,035
Awesome. Let's look at the things that you can edit in here.

45
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,795
There's different members to add to the card.

46
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:51,740
Let's say, the client is responsible for something or you're responsible for something,

47
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,485
you could click this.

48
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:57,770
What's really important that I want you to note here is dates.

49
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,865
Let's say that the client really wants this done by next week.

50
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:06,290
You can go ahead and change the due date here and hit "Save".

51
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,510
Now there's a date attached to it,

52
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,155
so everybody knows when to expect for this thing to be done.

53
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:16,310
When you have a task in a card,

54
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,775
it can also be broken down into more than one item.

55
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:25,630
You can create a checklist to be as transparent as possible about where that task is.

56
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,875
When the client asks you what the status is,

57
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,510
you can always open this card and show them where it's at.

58
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,930
In this card that we created called sign-in form,

59
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,480
there's more to it than just a sign in form.

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,320
There's going to be different features and steps that you need to take.

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,250
Let's go ahead and add a checklist.

62
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,065
You can name your checklist whatever you want and hit "Add".

63
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:56,700
Here let's add Design a form sent by designer,

64
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,400
Developed HTML and CSS of form,

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,980
then add Functionality to button of form.

66
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,330
Let's add these.

67
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,690
Once you're done with each of these,

68
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,680
you can check it off so that the client can just click on the card in

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,685
the list and see what phase you are of each task that you have to do.

70
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:25,300
For example, if you need to do

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,180
a specific task for each page on a website you're working on,

72
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,450
it'll be helpful to specify which one is complete and which one isn't.

73
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,930
Once you've completed all these tasks on the list,

74
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,920
you can say, okay, this is completed.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,470
Now, it moves from To Do to Be Approved,

76
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,660
and once the client approves it,

77
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,630
then that can be moved over to Approved by the Client.

78
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,845
It's very clear what needs to be done on this project still,

79
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:53,395
what the client still needs to look at.

80
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:55,390
The client can come in here and just see,

81
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,220
oh, I need to review these.

82
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,230
Then finally, once they've approved it,

83
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,700
they can move over here.

84
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,370
There's all of this visibility that

85
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,130
goes on without even having to have a meeting about it.

86
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,320
You can have as many boards,

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,240
lists, or cards as you want in a project.

88
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,015
This is a high level overview of Trello.

89
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,550
The beauty of Trello is that it's quick to

90
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,540
learn and can be used for very simple and complex projects.

91
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,685
Using a tool like Trello helps you stay

92
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,220
organized and on the same page as the client throughout

93
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,850
the project and can be very useful guide during check-in Meetings.
