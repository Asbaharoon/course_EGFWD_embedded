1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970
Now if you remember this whole mindset discussion on maximizing value for the client,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,490
remember that the client is running this project in order to get some value out of it.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,340
But they want to balance this value with the required amount of time and money,

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,970
that's why it becomes important to actively look out for

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,215
ways to work efficiently in the project.

6
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,910
Client may themselves not be conscious of what to prioritize and

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,905
how to bring that implicant balance in order for the overall project to be efficient.

8
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:37,155
But that's why they hired you.

9
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,100
They would assume that you would guide them

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,940
wherever you see areas of how to be most efficient,

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,580
so that they can achieve an optimal output with an optimal amount of time and money.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,450
Now let's look at some areas where one can bring efficiency in a client's project.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,350
First of all, it's important to pick the right tools,

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,365
to do the work that you have to do.

15
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:06,515
These tools could be caught by the off-the-shelf tools,

16
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:09,080
which would be either big or free.

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,665
These tools could either avoid reinventing the wheel

18
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:16,510
by already providing a workflow that we're looking to build,

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,310
or they could just help get work done faster.

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,575
For example, if the client wants to build a nice front end for a website,

21
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,890
you could just use a front-end framework like foundation,

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,420
that could avoid all the heavy lifting to build a nice front-end.

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,800
Or you can use an existing template and just customize it to suit the client's needs.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,255
Some of the tools that you find to be optimal may not be available for free,

25
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:43,775
but the client may just be happy to pay for them

26
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:47,460
if they bring in significant impact on productivity.

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,050
Now, another area to bring in efficiency is

28
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,800
your wisdom to optimize the sequence of workstreams.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,680
For example, you could prioritize working on

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,950
modules that could be reused later in the project.

31
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,030
Some modules may be dependent on other modules,

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,680
so you could prioritize the dependencies so that you

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,315
have them when you work with the modules that need them.

34
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:13,760
Now, it's important to note that this list of areas

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,925
to bring inefficiency is not exhaustive.

36
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:20,750
It is important to be on the lookout on how you can bring

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,325
inefficiency for the client's project depending on the project's context.

38
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:28,160
Again, keep in mind that the client may not be

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,935
proactive enough to make these optimizations,

40
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:33,725
even if they're technically qualified to do so.

41
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,990
Since you are working on the project,

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,160
it's important for you to determine how the entire project can be driven

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,565
most efficiently to result in optimal value for the client's investment in it.

44
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,285
But while you do that,

45
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,970
it's important to communicate that to the client.

46
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,115
Remember that communication discussion.

47
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:55,490
It's ideal if you communicate to the client in a manner

48
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,915
that they understand what value the optimization brings,

49
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:04,920
so that they can appreciate your contribution in bringing up that optimization.
