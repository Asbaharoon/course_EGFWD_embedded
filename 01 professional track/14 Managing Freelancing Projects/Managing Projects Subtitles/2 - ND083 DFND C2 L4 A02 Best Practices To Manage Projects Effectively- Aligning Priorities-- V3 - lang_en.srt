00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Let me give you an example from

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,745
my own experience of hiring a freelancer for our own startup.

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:09,675
FYI, I've tweaked the context setting of this example,

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,925
but the essence remains the same.

5
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:17,430
We hired a developer who we paid to build a module on our tech platform,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,550
which automatically would collect information about

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,425
social impact organizations who are trying to help underprivileged communities.

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,280
Now, this module has an admin interface where

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,090
the employees of our startup can see the status of the activity performed by the module.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,125
Now, we wanted to make the external interface of this module to be well-polished.

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,630
The developer we hired was really skilled at his job.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,640
In fact, I have not seen any developer better skilled than him

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,090
amongst all the freelancers that we have hired at that early in their careers so far.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,385
The developer did a good job building the module,

15
00:00:55,385 --> 00:01:00,185
but also focused on things we did not necessarily want to pay attention to.

16
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,035
Since the admin module will be used internally,

17
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:08,075
we did not want to make it as polished as the external facing module.

18
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:12,020
The developer insisted on making things look nice on

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,900
the admin module as well and the way they should be uniform across the platform.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,535
Theoretically, that's a good thing to do,

21
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:23,225
but that was not our priority and did not fit into our budget.

22
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,910
Our priority is what our users see.

23
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,615
Internally, we could do away with an okay-looking interface for an internal employees.

24
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:37,265
After some time, we ended up discontinuing work with that developer,

25
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:42,185
one of the best developers that we have ever had for a simple reason,

26
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,470
that we did not feel aligned with that developer.

27
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,960
When the alignment is missing, my friends,

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,434
every task becomes a challenge.

29
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:54,360
I'll reiterate the two main points that we discussed,

30
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,770
hear the client and sense what their priorities are.
