Good job.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,340
We are at the end of this important lesson where we learned how to

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,285
shine and use strategies to effectively manage projects,

4
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:12,270
where we learned about aligning with clients priorities,

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,640
importance of effective communication,

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,990
and working efficiently with the discussion on professionalism.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,930
We also talked about project management tools and when to use them,

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,425
with an introduction to Trello.

9
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,730
Finally, we looked at an edge case of scope

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,120
creep and our potential strategies in such a scenario.
