1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,525
Now, this one is a very important kind of communication that many a times freelancers or

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:12,405
people working at full-time jobs fail to do leading to bigger problems later.

3
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:17,490
Life doesn't go always as expected and things keep changing.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,565
Digital freelancing is no different.

5
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:24,630
But many a times you would foresee something as a blocker

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,860
to your plans for the project even before it comes.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,205
For example, based on the current base of the project,

8
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:35,715
you could assess if you're not on track to meet the deadline.

9
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:38,355
Or maybe there's a change on your person end

10
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:41,425
which could affect the deadline agreed for the client.

11
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:44,780
Sometimes there could be dependencies on other people

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,575
working for the client that you foresee not being met on time.

13
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:50,495
All of these is okay,

14
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,340
and part of any project.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,095
Clients do understand delays that are within reason.

16
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:59,310
What is not okay is not keeping the client in

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,330
the loop of any foreseeable delays or blockers in the project.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,650
This could lead to client frustration and give rise to blame game later.

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,590
Now, in many cases,

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,985
we as freelancers,

21
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:15,080
may think that even though the time is limited,

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,825
we might just be able to meet the deadline.

23
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:21,300
That's a good thing but giving your client a heads

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,475
up will make them prepared in case you're not able to do that.

25
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:29,240
In fact, they might be able to prioritize some of the stuff or

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,770
reduce the scope of the deliverable for that deadline if they are in the norm.

27
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,335
However, if you do meet the deadline,

28
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:38,705
it would be wonder for them and they'll be glad and

29
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:42,230
appreciate the extra effort you put in to meet the deadline.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,180
At the end I would say,

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,645
avoid understanding the importance of a heads up to the client.

32
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:53,135
After all, this will demonstrate your interest in maximizing value for the client,

33
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:57,520
and the fact that you respect their timeline and their commitments.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,290
Now, when a client starts a freelancing project,

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,375
they have a big picture in mind,

36
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:07,495
the final goal that they want to achieve through the project.

37
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:11,850
When you wear client's heart and try to maximize their value,

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,430
you'll want to demonstrate how your work fits into the big picture that they have.

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,930
Sometimes, we all get too bogged down with the details and we seem to forget

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,960
the big picture in mind and that may happen with the client as well.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,350
But if you as a freelancer keep pointing back to

42
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,910
the big picture and how our small steps are leading towards it,

43
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,055
it would be very valuable for the client.

44
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,460
Do not only put things in perspective,

45
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,610
but to also remind them of why we are working on

46
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,950
the current problem at hand and how it fits into the big picture.

47
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,680
This one in fact further reaffirm to the client that you are

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,420
thinking in their lines and they can trust you for the work on the project.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,105
Now an example of this kind of communication could be this,

50
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:09,860
when you're talking about why a GPS location detector is being built in the app and

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:16,995
how it fits into their model for their primary user segment or something like this,

52
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,980
reaffirming the client what advantage will be

53
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,315
gained with the front-end framework that is being used,

54
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:29,850
emphasizing on its mobile responsiveness and what use case or would be most useful then.
