00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,765
Hello and welcome to yet another lesson in our freelancing journey.

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:05,940
We have come a long way since we started.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,954
So far, we've talked about how to find clients,

4
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,205
what are the different avenues to find them,

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:15,585
and how to get a client's project by sending an expression of interest to them.

6
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:18,900
How to finalize a project scope and also pricing

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,160
structures before we start work on a client's project.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,280
Now this lesson is about real work.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,410
The real work that we do for the client.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,335
So far, all our preparation has been for this work.

11
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,290
Here we'll talk about best practices and

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,295
strategies of how we can manage the client's project effectively.

13
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:43,085
How can we deliver our best to the client,

14
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,810
as well as keep the client on the same page while doing that.

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,010
First, we'll start with best practices to manage projects effectively.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,430
We will talk about aligning priorities with the clients,

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,775
emphasize the need of a conscious communication and how to work efficiently.

18
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:05,185
Then we'll have a discussion on professionalism and its benefits.

19
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,370
We'll then talk a bit more detail about

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,650
the project management tools available out there,

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,950
their positives and negatives and

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,800
specifically go through one specific tool called Trello,

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,995
which you can use to manage projects or even small tasks.

24
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,775
Finally, we'll be talking about

25
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:27,650
an edge case of what to do when a scope creep happens in a project.

26
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,500
Lastly, we'll do a quick review of what we learned in the lesson overall.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,155
At the end of the lesson,

28
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:40,240
we'll be able to use best practices and strategies to manage client projects effectively.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,495
We'll also be able to adopt effective communication strategies and

30
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:50,280
tools to keep the client on the same page while you're working on the project.
