00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Now, earlier in this lesson,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,250
we talked about project management tools to be

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,345
a key element used to communicate the project status to the client.

4
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:13,350
They also help in project planning and project timelines,

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,170
as well as assigning tasks to different users.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,200
Now, there are a lot of tools out there that

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,650
offer a variety of features for a variety of projects.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,180
The advantage of most of these tools is that they are completely on the web,

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,255
which means you do not need to install anything.

10
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,745
You can access it from any computer,

11
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:37,350
any new features are automatically installed and available to you and you

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,610
can share your work in project with any user just by entering their email.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,060
But let's look at some pros and cons of a project management tool and in

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,940
what situations it is a good idea to use

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,785
them and situations that it is not a good idea to use them.

16
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:56,420
First, project management tools

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,825
definitely help us with managing complexities in the project.

18
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,030
If there are too many moving parts,

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,220
lots of different phases of the project,

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,830
long timelines, you may want to use

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,290
a sophisticated project management tool to manage all that complexity.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,630
Now, if there are many users working on the same project,

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,080
it does make sense to use a proper tool for everyone to be on

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,835
the same page and for streamline status updates, etc.

25
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:25,460
Project management tools are, of course,

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,155
a communication tool, but they can be used for day-to-day communication as well.

27
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:34,040
Like you can tag people on specific tasks and leave comments.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,515
You could start a quick chat with another user.

29
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:42,280
This may also help reduce or eliminate another communication channel within the company.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,085
These tools can also help with setting timelines.

31
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,395
To liaise Gantt charts, for example,

32
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,790
you can set reminders for when a deadline is approaching.

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,275
You can also set alerts for any unexpected activity in the project.

34
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:59,090
On the other side, project management tools

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,335
generally take time to learn and get a handle on.

36
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:06,585
This could be a blocker for users with low technical aptitude.

37
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,800
It could take up to a few months before a team in

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,670
a large project gets comfortable using a project management tool.

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,630
Project management tools are also not a good fit for

40
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,970
projects where the overhead of the tool exceeds the benefits it provides.

41
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,990
Some banks for small projects,

42
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,960
the overhead of using a tool is much higher,

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,675
both in terms of cost and bang.

44
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,720
For those projects, a Google Sheet or maybe

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,870
a Google Doc may be sufficient for project communication.
