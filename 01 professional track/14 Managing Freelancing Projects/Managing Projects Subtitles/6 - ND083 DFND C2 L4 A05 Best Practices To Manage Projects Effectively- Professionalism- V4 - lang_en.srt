00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Now the last topic in our series of best practices to manage project is professionalism.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,615
Professionalism is more of an attitude,

3
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:12,795
something that is displayed by the way you work with the clients.

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,100
The way you take decisions,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,765
the way you deal with unexpected situations.

6
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:18,345
In this part of the lesson,

7
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:20,580
we'll talk about some areas of work in

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,105
your freelancing journey that could portray professionalism.

9
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:27,480
But you'll realize that professionalism is something that is

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,035
naturally developed as one works with clients all the time.

11
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,505
First of all,

12
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,260
what I've learned in my freelancing career is that attention to

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,370
detail goes a long way in making a successful freelancing career.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,075
The client would love,

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,910
if your work is detailed enough,

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,745
your communication is detailed and specific.

17
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,260
If you're writing software code,

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,100
for example, the code is clear with comments.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,975
In fact, I would go on to say that do less if you have to but do it well,

20
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,100
instead of doing a bunch of things half-baked.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,440
But you will realize that this aspect of attention

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
to detail has to be balanced with pragmatism.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
The client may be in a hurry to get the first version

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,785
out and may not want you to spend time on the details,

25
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:16,160
in which case the scope of work is limited but

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,640
make sure you do a precise job within that scope.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,460
Try it out and see how it helps you in

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,810
your relationship with the client and future prospects.

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,729
Knowing time and material projects precisely,

30
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,790
logging time will not only give you satisfaction,

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,220
but the client will appreciate our integrity to

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,955
precisely maintain a log of the time you spent.

33
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:41,150
You don't want to hurt your reputation for a few hours on the time log.

34
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:47,060
In some cases, I have even gone ahead and shared my precise time log with the client.

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,370
Even when I didn't have to and could just share with them the total spent,

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,175
but that gives more comfort and transparency to the client.

37
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,770
They feel more comfortable working with you.

38
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,445
If you find yourself jacking up a few hours to gain some money,

39
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:04,685
believe me, you're not the first one to try that,

40
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:07,280
but that'll only leave you dissatisfying.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,615
There will always be an insecurity about the client questioning the time log,

42
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,805
leading to the lack of confidence in your work.

43
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:17,645
Lastly, attention to detail in

44
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:22,025
written and verbal communication not only portrays your professionalism,

45
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,870
but it also gives an impression to

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,800
the client that you're serious about what you're doing.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,625
Minor things like good grammar in an email,

48
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,635
using correct cases in words,

49
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:33,555
naming convention of files,

50
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:36,285
or perhaps variables in a source code.

51
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:42,865
All of these do matter and demonstrate your alertness and seriousness towards the work.

52
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:45,825
Next, being professional is good,

53
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,630
but being always professional is better.

54
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,640
I have discovered that being consistent in the quality of work,

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,145
the timelines, the deliverables,

56
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:58,045
your consistent communication builds

57
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,890
clients' trust in you and this solid relationship with the client,

58
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,085
could lead to a longer engagement and more projects in the future.

59
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:10,145
Next, as touched upon briefly in the previous lesson,

60
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:12,830
it will demonstrate your professionalism if you

61
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,980
stay within the legal limits of any work that you do.

62
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,689
For example, it's important to stay within the legal limits of the freelancing platform,

63
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:22,265
as we discussed earlier.

64
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:25,010
If you bypass the platform and get the payment

65
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,160
directly from the client to avoid the intermediary fee,

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,335
even if the client is happy with that,

67
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,875
you may see losing their respect over time.

68
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,595
If you're using third party libraries in your code,

69
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,865
for example, the GitHub library,

70
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:40,610
it's important to check the licenses and

71
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,470
discuss with the client it's applicability in their project.

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,355
Lastly, doing things right,

73
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:53,850
give some authority which can only be understood with your own practical experience.

74
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,530
Now sometimes in your freelancing career,

75
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,735
things may not go as expected.

76
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:03,635
The client may not echo to what was discussed at the outset.

77
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:06,590
The scope may change significantly or

78
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,050
the client's deadlines will suddenly change expecting you to meet them.

79
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,185
The culture in the client's organization may not be courteous enough

80
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:19,950
even if you are trying to maximize value for the client and being professional.

81
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,035
Now, this is the time to focus on ethical communication,

82
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:27,170
which could go really a long way instead of reacting

83
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,340
to the situation which could lead to a long-term loss.

84
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,890
Sometimes responding instead of reacting helps us a big deal.
