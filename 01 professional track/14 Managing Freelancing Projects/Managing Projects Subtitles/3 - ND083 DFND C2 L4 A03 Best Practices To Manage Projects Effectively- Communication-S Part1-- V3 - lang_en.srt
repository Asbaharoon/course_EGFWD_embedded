1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,595
Now we come to the second aspect of managing projects, which is communication.

2
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,230
Doing good work is, of course,

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,450
important, but not enough.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,125
Keeping the client in the loop of that good work is critical.

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,050
It's also important to note here that most of

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,690
the digital freelancing that you do could be done remotely.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,365
You may never end up meeting the client in person.

8
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:25,695
This does leave room for misunderstandings and hence,

9
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:29,940
the need to think about a communication strategy at the outset.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,415
Now, communication in the project could be of different types and at different levels.

11
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:39,720
The most indispensable kind of communication is project status,

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,660
which is nothing but informing what was done since the last update.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,430
This, as you can imagine,

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,170
is the most common and obvious kind of communication in any project.

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,340
The client wants to know where you are in the project and what's going to happen next.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,564
Now, this kind of communication is done through various means,

17
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:05,015
depending on the size of the project and preference of the client.

18
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,680
Some clients may want to use

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,150
sophisticated project management tools like Trello or Wrike and others.

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,060
Other clients may just be okay with e-mail updates coupled with calls with the client.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,890
Other communication tools like

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,955
Slack and WhatsApp groups are also common for such updates.

23
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:25,760
It is also a good idea to maintain

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,530
a schedule to periodically update the client about the project's status.

25
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,870
This scheduling could also be facilitated by these tools.

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,590
You will see us coming back to project management tools later in the lesson and even

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,365
picking up one tool to see how we can use it to manage a client's project.

28
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,180
Now, another kind of update is conveying

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,255
the design decisions of the solution that you make while you're working on the project.

30
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:56,975
This kind of communication may or may not be asked for by the client,

31
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:00,185
depending on the client's technical expertise in the project,

32
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:02,000
but it's important for you,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,230
as a freelancer,

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,470
to convey these design decisions.

35
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,080
This not only demonstrates your ability to think about

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,875
a problem holistically instead of picking a one-sided approach,

37
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:18,205
but also demonstrates your expertise and knowledge in the task that you're working on.

38
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,645
The client would really appreciate that you're

39
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:24,160
keeping them in the loop about how you're building the solution.

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,375
This also educates them about the possible ways to work on the solution and

41
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:34,925
makes them gain confidence that they're investing in a well thought out solution.

42
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:38,080
Lastly, this could be your chance to let them

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,770
know about the efficient means that you use to work on a solution,

44
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,940
making the work more productive and efficient.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,025
Now let's see what could be the examples of such kind of communication.

46
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:52,510
For example, if a client has asked you to make a script,

47
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,105
to make all the numbers human-readable,

48
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,835
like adding commas, number formats,

49
00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:59,110
date and time formats,

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,915
and so on in a web application,

51
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:07,825
you could just tell the client that you would do it through the Python humanize library.

52
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:12,830
This will save a lot of time writing the code and hence would be more efficient.

53
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,444
If you're working on a digital marketing solution and trying to find in-links,

54
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:22,505
you can inform the client of the design decision of not scraping the logs,

55
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:26,945
but using a third party tool that can be used with commercial applications.

56
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:30,230
There could also be other kinds of design decisions,

57
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,720
like the design of the process itself.

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,745
For example, working on a detail spec before starting to build a module,

59
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:40,470
given the complexity of it.
