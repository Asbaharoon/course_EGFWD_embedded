1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Here's an example of that.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,650
I was once working for a large client with offices in more than one country.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,375
I was working on a module,

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:14,880
which needed some significant data from another stakeholder within the same organization.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,450
This was a hard dependency that was not being met

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,775
despite many reminders to the stakeholder who was supposed to provide that data.

7
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,739
The business for surprisingly,

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:32,125
not pushing the stakeholder to get that data to me and things kept getting delayed.

9
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,780
Later on, I did get the data and implemented the module,

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,090
but it was way past the deadline.

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,240
When it was time for payment for that module,

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,640
the client was not very willing to make the payment in

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,125
full and mentioned reasons like the delay caused in the delivery.

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:52,160
I knew that there were significant delays because of this

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,425
dependency not being fulfilled and not entirely because of the delays my end.

16
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:01,040
But this was not the time to lose my cool.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,060
I approached the client and asked them to get on a call.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,985
This is the time to take care of your relationship with the client and not get mad.

19
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,285
Believe me, I was mad from within.

20
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,220
But when I talked to the client,

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,510
I tried to keep calm and focus on the main issue,

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,545
and tried to point out reasons for delay to the client.

23
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:26,780
I also gently asked if I could pause working

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,985
further on the project until this payment of this module is cleared.

25
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:33,980
The discussion with the client helped clarify

26
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,775
the disconnect and calm down the matters. Guess what?

27
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:40,610
The client agreed to make the payment in full,

28
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,895
and also pause the project until the payment was cleared.

29
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,940
Eventually, I decided not to pause the project and kept

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,590
going in good faith and the client paid me in full.

31
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,525
In fact, the client went ahead and signed

32
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:56,540
another contract with me for the next six months.

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,570
This time, I could put my terms in the contract

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,930
about the dependencies and how and when they should be fulfilled.

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,055
Something like this did not happen again and did not affect my payments.

36
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:10,400
Making sure that your communication is ethical,

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,505
may not just help you traverse through a difficult situation better,

38
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:16,105
it might end up winning the client for you.

39
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,580
On the flip side,

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,200
when things go ory and the communication becomes unethical,

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,529
it starts getting deflected in the payment disputes,

42
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:30,160
disagreements, and bad reviews which could adversely affect a freelancing career.

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,980
In short responding is way better than reacting.
