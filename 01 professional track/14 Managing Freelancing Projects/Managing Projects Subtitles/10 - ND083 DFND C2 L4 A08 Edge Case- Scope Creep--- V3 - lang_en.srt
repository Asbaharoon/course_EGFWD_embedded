00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Now here we will talk about how in some projects a scope creep may happen,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,350
that could be detrimental to

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,800
the freelancers relationship with the client and the project.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,805
But first let's try to understand what a scope creep is.

5
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,395
In the last lesson,

6
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:21,915
we talked in detail about a project score that you and the client would agree upon.

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:24,450
This is a detailed document explaining

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,320
the features of work streams that you will work on in the project.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,430
Now let's say you and the client agreed on requirements A,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,710
B, C, and D for a project.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,165
After a while,

12
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:39,435
client also adds requirement A1,

13
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:44,205
which as per the client's claim was anyway a part of A1,

14
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:49,910
whereas per you it was not a part of the original score and is a new requirement.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,920
This is a scenario in which a scope creep has happened.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,470
While you as a freelancer have the opinion that

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,150
a new requirement is added in the middle of the project which was not decided earlier.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,420
Scope creeps could create misunderstandings and

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,335
frustrations amongst both the client and the freelancer.

20
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:15,235
Sometimes they even become the cause of the client and the freelancer parting ways.

21
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:19,350
But the question is, what to do when a scope creep happens?

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,820
Now, really the best strategy to deal with a scope creep is to avoid it.

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,900
You can avoid it by having

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,745
a detailed enough requirements specification at the start of the project.

25
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:35,905
This will significantly help reduce the chances of a scope creep,

26
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:39,900
and will also help the client think clearly about the project.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,025
Now the second important thing to keep in mind is that scope creeps do happen.

28
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:49,130
Things do change in the course of the project and when they happen,

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,325
it is important to educate the client and while

30
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:56,335
you as a freelancer think that a requirement is out of scope.

31
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:58,020
If the client agrees,

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,080
calculate the Delta effort and give a new effort estimate to the client.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,315
If the client is convinced that it is a new requirement,

34
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:10,805
they may be happy to factor in the new cost or time required to work on the requirement.

35
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:14,945
That said, sometimes the client is indeed right,

36
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:20,765
or sometimes the Delta effort is not so much as to put the whole contract in jeopardy.

37
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,115
If that's the case,

38
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:25,850
it is in your best interest to give benefit of doubt to the client

39
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,020
and go ahead and work on the requirement as part of the original estimate.
