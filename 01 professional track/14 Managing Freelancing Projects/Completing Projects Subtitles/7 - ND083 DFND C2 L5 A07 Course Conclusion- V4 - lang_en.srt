00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,795
We are now concluding the course.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,555
Good job on reaching up till here.

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:12,150
Let's do a very high-level recap of what all we've covered in each lesson.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,750
First, we started with an introduction to the course,

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,980
followed by how to create a process to source clients,

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,650
different avenues available to find clients,

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,185
and also apply to work for them.

8
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:28,490
Then when a client shows interest in working with us,

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,060
we discussed the importance of a project scope and how to choose a pricing framework.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,340
Then we discussed strategies to manage projects

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,750
effectively with the mindset of maximizing value for the client.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,875
Lastly, we discussed how to formally close a project and secure your payment.

13
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,015
This marks the end of this course,

14
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:53,915
but let me say something before we take leave.

15
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,230
We have gone through a lot of material in this course.

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,990
I'd say take the guidelines discussed in this course as guidelines,

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,905
and not hard rules.

18
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:07,550
In freelancing, there is no one size that fits all.

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,405
You may work with people from different countries and different cultures.

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,610
As you work with more and more clients,

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,870
you will naturally develop a pattern and intuition to work with clients.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,790
I have personally experienced that the power of intuition helps a great deal when it

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,025
comes to decision-making while working with the client much more than in a rule book.

24
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:30,140
Trust your gut as you move along,

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,155
you might be surprised how many times you're right.

26
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:37,470
In the end, don't forget to enjoy while you take this journey.
