00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,885
In this final lesson,

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:09,580
we will talk about what needs to be done when you've reached the end of the project.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,920
This phase is important to smoothly close out

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,225
the project and also secure final payment from the client.

5
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:21,630
Now let's look at what we will cover in this lesson.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,755
First, we will talk about marking the deliverables as complete.

7
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:31,950
Both the client and the developer are on the same page that the required job is done.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:39,030
Next, we'll talk about securing payments and sending invoices to clients wherever needed.

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,870
We'll also talk about what to do in case we get a bad review on a freelancing platform.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,625
Lastly, we'll end with a quick recap of what we went through in this lesson.

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:54,310
Now let's look at what we'll be able to do at the end of this lesson.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,350
First, we'll be able to effectively assess with

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,500
the claim that all the deliverables are met.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,800
Then we'll be able to secure payments from the client and

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,480
also be able to send invoices wherever needed.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,920
Lastly, we'll also be able to manage situations where we get a bad review from

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,470
a client on a platform to reduce chances of defecting our future prospects.
