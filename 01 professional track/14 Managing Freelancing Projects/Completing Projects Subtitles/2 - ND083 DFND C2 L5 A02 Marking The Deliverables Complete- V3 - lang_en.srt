1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,625
Now when we are done with the project,

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:06,540
it becomes important for us to be on the same page with the client,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,085
so that both parties agree that the requirements have been met.

4
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:14,775
Now this becomes important for two reasons.

5
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,715
Especially in fixed cost projects,

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:22,040
your final payment from the client could be blocked until the client

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,845
confirms that all the requirements in the project scope have been met.

8
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:30,320
Second, it formally ends the project and

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,075
marks an end to the time that you need to spend on the project,

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,430
so now you can allocate your time to other projects.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,690
You don't want the client to keep coming back to you with small fixes even after

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,700
a month of finishing the project just

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,595
because the client got delayed in validating the solution.

14
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,500
For fixed cost projects,

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,395
that could mean you spending extra time for the claim for an indefinite period of time.

16
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,245
For time and materials project,

17
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:58,310
that could mean extra revenue for you but could also be

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,375
a distraction if you're working on other larger project that needs your attention.

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,930
Now in order to meet the deliverable complete and not keep the project lingering,

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,195
there are two things that we can do.

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:15,220
First, it is important to communicate in writing that from your perspective,

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,080
you have completed the project,

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,690
but the client is free to come back and let

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,525
you know if they think that there are things to be done.

25
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,300
For example, there may be bugs in the software application,

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,750
you bet, or workstreams left out in a digital marketing solution.

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,680
Why is this important?

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,580
This helps with two things.

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,175
First, it creates a record of you informing the client that the work is done.

30
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:44,170
Second, it puts a timestamp on when you are done with the work.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,360
It is generally a good idea for this to be sent from

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,850
your own email account and not just

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,470
mentioned in a project management tool or a communication tool

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,400
like Skype so that you have a permanent record of that communication even

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,730
after you leave the project and no longer have access to clients communication tools.

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,280
If the client gave you a separate email address to communicate with,

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,515
you could send email from that email address and cc your own email address,

38
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,150
so you have a record.

39
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,920
If needed, you can mention it to the client so they're okay with it.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,660
Secondly, we need to make sure to set a timeline

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,640
until which the client can come back to you instead of keeping it indefinite.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,970
For example, you can say that the client is free to come

43
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,570
back within 48 hours of delivery of the final submission,

44
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,050
in case they have any issues with it.

45
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,930
If you have a contract or a service agreement with the client,

46
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,275
it is a good idea to put this clause in there.

47
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,670
If not, you can put it nicely in

48
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,790
the email that you send to the client for the final submission,

49
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,860
so they know that they have to get back within a definite time period.

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,720
This will help set a deadline to your availability for the project,

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,185
and you can avoid a scenario where the client

52
00:02:57,185 --> 00:03:00,290
keeps coming back to you even after a month of delivery,

53
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,190
finding issues in your work that you may feel obligated to fix.
