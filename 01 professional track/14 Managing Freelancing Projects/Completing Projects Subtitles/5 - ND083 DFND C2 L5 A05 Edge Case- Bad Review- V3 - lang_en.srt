1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
All right. Life is not perfect.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,365
In some cases,

3
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:08,370
you may end up getting a bad review or less than a five-star rating,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,780
despite your efforts to help the client.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,715
A bad review could reduce our chances of getting more jobs,

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,130
especially if you don't have many reviews,

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,600
but there are a couple of things that you can do to mitigate the risks.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,285
First, talk to the client.

9
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:28,020
If you're not sure of the reason of the low rating or the bad review,

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,210
gently ask them if there was something that you could do to make them satisfied,

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,240
or was there a requirement that was not met.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,635
Try to gauge by talking to the client on what went wrong.

13
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:43,775
Chances are that they will not respond.

14
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,280
However, if they do respond,

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,770
you might get another chance to either fix the problem or give the client

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,610
a reasonable explanation of the cause of the perceived low quality of the job,

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,885
which may lead to the client changing the review.

18
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:02,190
But keep in mind that platforms do not encourage

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,430
freelancers to force clients to change their rating.

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,020
That is why it is important for you to gently ask them

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,860
to see if something can be done to improve the rating or review.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,645
For any bad review,

23
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:19,940
some platforms remove the review if you give a 100 percent refund to the client.

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,070
You don't get paid for the work you did,

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,995
and hence you don't get a bad review.

26
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:27,555
Alternatively, you could also try a partial refund.

27
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:31,580
For example, you could do a 50 percent refund to the client.

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,580
In this case, the platform may not remove the review,

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,540
but the client may be okay to reconsider the review.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,925
Sometimes you know that you have done a good job,

31
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,445
but the client is difficult to be convinced.

32
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:47,420
In this case, you may not be willing to give a refund to the client,

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,110
especially if the money involved is sizable.

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,540
In that case, it is okay to approach the support team

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,870
of the freelancing platform and explain them your case.

36
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,580
If they are indeed convinced,

37
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,555
they may be willing to remove the review for you.

38
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,670
Sometimes you may indeed have messed

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,750
up and the client is justified in leaving a bad review,

40
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,970
or even if you did a good job,

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,535
the platform or the client may not be willing to edit or remove the review.

42
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,725
It's okay to accept that and move on.

43
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,640
Life is not always fair.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,220
If you get a lot of other good reviews,

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,375
this one bad review,

46
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,400
may not count that much.

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,995
Though it may get difficult to get your next client,

48
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:31,840
and you may have to put in some extra effort there.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,280
If a new client asks you about

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,550
the bad review and they find your explanation within reason,

51
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,470
they might be okay to try you out.
