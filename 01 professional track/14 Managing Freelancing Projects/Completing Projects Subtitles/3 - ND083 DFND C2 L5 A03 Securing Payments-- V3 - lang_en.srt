1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,385
All right. Once you are done with the clients work and mark the deliverable is complete,

2
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:07,860
it is time for you to get paid for it.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,910
If you're going through a freelancing platform this is much easier,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,840
since usually these platforms have an escrow feature where

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,685
the client deposits the payment for the project before the project starts,

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:23,340
and the platform releases it to

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,305
the freelancer once both parties agree that the work has been completed.

8
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:33,585
The advantage of this arrangement is that the money lies with an intermediary now,

9
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:38,820
and could be helpful in dispute management that a third party needs to be involved.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,855
For example, if the platform agrees that the freelancer indeed deserves for payment,

11
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:46,610
they could release it to the freelancer since they have

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,860
the money even if the client is not willing to make the payment for the work done.

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,030
This also helps in timely payments since the freelancer is no longer

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,410
dependent on the client to make the payment. A [inaudible].

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,210
You really don't want to get into a situation where the platform intervenes.

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,695
As much as possible,

17
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:11,145
try to see if you can settle it with the client yourself. All right.

18
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:15,065
When it's time to get paid and you are on a freelancing platform,

19
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,735
you could just mark the job is done on the platform,

20
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:22,655
and you're all set for the escrow to be released and get paid.

21
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,310
If the freelancing platform does not have

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,895
an escrow feature or if you're not working through freelancing platform,

23
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,790
you can just send a note to the client to get paid.

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,310
Now at this point,

25
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,730
some times clients may insist on

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,185
a formal invoice to be sent to them for the services provided.

27
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:43,190
That usually depends on how the internal processes work in the client's company,

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,890
usually the auto-generated note or invoice sent

29
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,915
by the freelancing platform maybe enough or the client.

30
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:51,710
But the client may need a formal invoice directly from

31
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,920
you as a freelancer who provided the services.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,750
You are anyways need to do that for off platform clients.

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,120
In the next section, we'll cover what goes in,

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,650
in such an invoice for the client.
