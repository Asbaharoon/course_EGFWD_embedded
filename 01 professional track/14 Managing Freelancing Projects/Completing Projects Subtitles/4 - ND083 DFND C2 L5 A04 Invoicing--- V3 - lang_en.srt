1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,470
Let's look at a sample invoice and the key elements that appear in an invoice.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,060
First and foremost, you need a date on the invoice.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,640
This timestamps when the request was made to the client to make the payment.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,945
Invoice ID is your own ID of the invoice that you maintain internally across all clients.

5
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,900
You could choose a format that you prefer here.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,235
But keep in mind that this ID would be across all invoices and all clients.

7
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:35,775
For legal identification purposes,

8
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:41,139
you need to put your name and exact office or home address in the invoice.

9
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:44,210
Sometimes, depending on your local tax law,

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,960
you may need to include your income tax ID as well as your service tax ID in the invoice.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,000
These IDs are termed differently in different countries.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,725
For example, if you're in the US,

13
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,515
service tax maybe termed as sales tax.

14
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,645
If you are in India or Canada,

15
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:04,120
service tax maybe termed as GST or goods and services tax.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,620
Keep in mind that in some countries there is no service tax for international services.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,550
You could simply check your local tax law online to figure that out.

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,930
Alternatively, you could just look up a sample invoice online that was generated for

19
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,945
your country of residence to get an idea of the tax IDs you need in invoice.

20
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:27,495
In this example, the GST registration number is mentioned,

21
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,200
but the GST charge is zero percent,

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,900
since the client is in a different country.

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,700
You may also need to put the client's name and address for whom this invoice is for.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,670
If you're invoicing a company instead of an individual,

25
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,225
you'll put the company's name and address here.

26
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:48,440
Services provided list down the services that you provided to the client.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,530
For example, you could say you build a web application on

28
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,520
Python or you could get granular and list all the modules built.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,070
Note that in this example,

30
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,350
since it was a time and materials contract,

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,145
the freelancer has put the details of everything that she spent

32
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:08,180
time on along with the hours she spent on each of them,

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,530
clearly specifying the rate and the aggregated cost for each item.

34
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,230
Put the total at the bottom.

35
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,820
Keep in mind though, that a break up is only required if

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,320
you agree to give a break up to the client when negotiating the cost.

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,690
If you're charging a lump-sum fixed cost,

38
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,155
you can just mention it in one line item if you so prefer.

39
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:31,580
Next, it is important to mention how the client can pay you.

40
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,340
The mode of payments that you're willing to accept.

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,290
For example, you could put in

42
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,550
your bank account information for a bank transfer or could give

43
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,420
your e-wallet ID to use

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,625
a digital wallet payment or you could use a PayPal or UPI to get payment.

45
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,860
Do keep in mind that if this is an invoice for

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,830
a client that you've worked with via a freelancing platform,

47
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,930
you cannot accept direct payments to your account.

48
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,305
The payment has to be made through the platform.

49
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,920
In which case, you can mention the platform name as a mode of

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,815
the payment or you can skip the mode of the payment in such an invoice.

51
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:12,755
The freelancer decided to put two modes of payment here,

52
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:16,465
her bank account for a bank transfer and a PayPal account.

53
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:20,570
Now due date is not mandatory to put in an invoice but it is

54
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,010
a good idea to put it to mark a deadline when the payment is due.

55
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,235
You could choose to put it depending on your understanding with the client on this.

56
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,305
Now in the digital world,

57
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:35,345
signatures are no longer mandatory in an invoice.

58
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,985
You sending the invoice from your email address

59
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,245
is enough proof that it originated from you.

60
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:43,955
For digital invoices without signatures,

61
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:47,255
you could optionally put a line at the bottom that says

62
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:51,950
this invoice is digitally generated and does not require a signature.

63
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,565
Alternatively, you could use a digital signature.

64
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:58,610
Alternatively, if the client insist,

65
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,420
you could even put a real signature using signature tools available in PDF viewers.

66
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,720
Now keep in mind that the format of the invoices is not

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,980
fixed and we are free to choose a format that works for you.

68
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,550
For example, you could place your address at the bottom of

69
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,395
the invoice instead of at the top or you could put the due date at the bottom.

70
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:26,990
Do remember to send this invoice as an email to the client from your own email account,

71
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,020
not from a client owned email account that you got

72
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,470
temporarily or via a client's chat application.

73
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,150
Sending it as an email from

74
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,275
your own email address will create a permanent record of it for you to refer back later.

75
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:46,820
Lastly, instead of sending the invoice to the client as an editable document,

76
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,720
it's a good idea to export it in PDF format and then send it out since PDF formats are

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,550
widely acceptable on different operating systems and

78
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,730
a client would not need a license software to open it.
