00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,815
Let's look at what we have covered in the lesson so far.

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:09,985
We started off by introducing the project scope and pricing framework,

3
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:14,220
then we talked about how these two are interrelated.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,980
Then we talked a bit about the rate strategy when you're starting a freelancing career,

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,550
and how maximizing the value for the client can work in your favor.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,905
Then we touched upon the NDAs,

7
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:29,325
which are non-disclosure agreements and service agreements,

8
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:32,280
and how to avoid the usual pitfalls.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,580
Lastly, we covered the edge case of bypassing

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,410
the platform to help you traverse scenarios that you may not be expecting.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,810
In the next lesson,

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,710
we'll talk about how to effectively manage your projects so that you can

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,540
maximize the value for the client as well as balance it with a good revenue for you.
