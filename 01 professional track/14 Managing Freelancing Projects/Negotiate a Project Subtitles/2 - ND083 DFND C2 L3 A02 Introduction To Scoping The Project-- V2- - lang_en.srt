1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,130
Now let's first talk about what is a project scope.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,770
Once you agree to work with the client,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,800
the first thing that you need to discuss and preferably

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,190
document is what exactly you will be working on,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,145
which is called the project scope.

6
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:21,375
Now, a project scope would usually entail two things.

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:25,170
First, what is the final goal of the project,

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,005
the expected output of the work,

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,065
and second, what needs to be done to reach this goal?

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,100
What are the building blocks,

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,950
things like features of the solution or

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,250
work-streams that the clients wants you to work on?

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,920
Now, it's important to keep in mind here that

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,120
a project scope is a document that is given to a freelancer to work on.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,720
You can, of course, help the client writer project scope, but ideally,

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,565
it's the business that knows best what work needs to be done, and hence,

17
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,830
it is ideal for it to either come from

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,930
them or is written in active collaboration with them.

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,765
Let's see a few examples to make this more clear.

20
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,600
Let's say you're building a web application,

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,415
which is your end goal.

22
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:14,420
The project scope will include the features that need to be built,

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,730
like the authentication module,

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,560
a chatbot perhaps,

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,615
a module to automatically send emails to users, and so on.

26
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:27,605
If you're working on a digital marketing project for a website,

27
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:30,740
this will include the different work streams along with

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,775
their details like search engine optimization,

29
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:39,695
social media campaigns, Twitter ads, and so on.

30
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,885
If you are working in DevOps,

31
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:47,450
then tasks like ability to start 20 servers automatically on the Cloud,

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,220
shut down those servers automatically,

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,060
build cleanup scripts to run after a server task is completed, and so on.

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,830
This is a high-level description of what a project scope is,

35
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,660
and some examples of it.

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,445
In the rest of the lesson,

37
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:07,130
you will see us coming back to the project scope

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,070
and how it is so important in a client's project.
