00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,165
We talked about project scope and pricing structure and how they are interdependent.

2
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:10,095
Now let's talk a little bit about how these work in real life.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:13,530
What kind of pricing structures are most common?

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,050
How do the clients react in different scenarios?

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,175
Firstly, for any sizable project,

6
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,165
fixing the scope at the start of the project is quite hard.

7
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:26,715
In the last 16 years of my career,

8
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,520
whatever software development projects I have seen,

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,425
there have been hardly any project

10
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:35,955
whose requirements did not change significantly by the end of the project.

11
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:38,175
This is not because of human error,

12
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:40,680
but because of theoretical limitations.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,720
Sometimes, it is just too hard to imagine the end goal in

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,855
a very granular way until you start seeing its bits and pieces coming together.

15
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,880
In software projects, especially,

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,575
the clients often question their own assumptions,

17
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,945
change some modules significantly,

18
00:00:56,945 --> 00:01:00,625
or change the entire direction of the project midway.

19
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,630
Now, that makes a time and material or the [inaudible] model more compelling for

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,540
freelancing projects because the clients may not even

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,735
know what they do not know at the start of the project.

22
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:17,750
But that does not mean that fixed cost projects are not common, they are common.

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,010
In fact, they are used in general as long as there is enough buffer,

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,395
including the proposed cost for any significant changes.

25
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:30,260
I personally prefer the time and material model with

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,390
new clients because that gives the client and myself time to test each other.

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,450
The client does not have to make a big commitment of plan,

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,285
nor am I logged in with the client at this chart.

29
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:45,230
Also, the client may not really have the scope of the project defined in

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,200
detail and may not sometimes understand the importance of having a detailed scope.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,135
Thirdly, if you as a freelancer,

32
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,905
give a fixed cost to the client,

33
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:58,280
which according to you is justified based on the effort estimate,

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,650
the client may not even agree to it and refuse to give the project to you.

35
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,510
But usually, when you start working on the project,

36
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,990
the client slowly develops an appreciation for the amount of work

37
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,795
involved and is more liberal and trusting to spend their money on the project.

38
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:17,510
Starting with time and materials pricing not only helps

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,250
the client to not make an upfront commitment and test the waters first,

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,770
it also helps them to learn what it takes to reach the end goal of

41
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,520
the project so they can better evaluate the pricing of the project.
