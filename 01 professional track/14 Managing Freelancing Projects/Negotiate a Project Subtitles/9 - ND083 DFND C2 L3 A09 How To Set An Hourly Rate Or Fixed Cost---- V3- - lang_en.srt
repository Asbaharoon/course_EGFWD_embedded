1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, since we have a good understanding of the scope

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,240
and the pricing structure and how they're correlated,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,375
let's take a deeper dive into how to set rates or fixed costs for the project.

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:17,910
You know that for a time and materials or in hourly model as it's sometimes called,

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,519
we need to set a rate for ourselves.

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,460
That is the amount of money that we expect to pay

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,690
the client for every hour that we spend on their project.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,465
When you start on a freelancing platform,

9
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:34,170
take a moment to browse it under their profiles and other rates,

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,750
you'll see a large variation among them.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,340
Some freelancers maybe you okay to charge $10 an hour or $20 an hour,

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,210
while some may charge $50 an hour to $60 an hour.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,285
It is also common to see rates of a $100,

14
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,685
even $150 or beyond.

15
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,460
But that really leaves us with the question,

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,395
what should hour rate be?

17
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,740
How to figure out a rate?

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,165
But before that, let's get back to a mindset of thinking from the client's point of view.

19
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,640
From a client's perspective when they are

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,675
deciding whether to hire a freelancer from a freelancing platform,

21
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:14,255
they would primarily look at three things.

22
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:18,155
The profile of the freelancer that we talked about in the previous lesson,

23
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:19,895
which talks about the freelancer,

24
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:22,630
their skills, and any experience.

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,035
Then they would look at the reviews that are the clients have left about the work

26
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:31,145
that they got done from the freelancer and of course,

27
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:34,150
how much it would cost them to hire the freelancer.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,765
Now we have to keep in mind that we are in a marketplace where there may be

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,750
other freelancers bidding for the same project that we have expressed interest in.

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,660
Let's say we have a freelancer who has a very similar profile then

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,920
ours and has the same cost as ours, but better reviews.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,180
There is a high chance that the client goes ahead with

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,860
the other freelancer since she is specifically a better candidate at the same rate.

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,190
Even though we can't charge the same rate as other freelancers on the platform,

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,650
lack of reviews from other clients is

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,500
something that could be a blocker for us to charge that rate.

37
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,625
The question is, how to get good reviews?

38
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:23,240
But you'll notice now that there is really a chicken and egg problem here.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,050
Freelancers who have good reviews on the platform,

40
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,950
get hired because that's a testimony of their work for new clients.

41
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,564
However, to get good reviews,

42
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,805
we need to get hired.

43
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:39,800
This could be a pretty hard problem when

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,355
we are just starting out their freelancing careers.

45
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:44,300
But to really break this deadlock,

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,795
it will be helpful to again go back to focusing on quality work for the client.

47
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,825
Let me describe that by taking an example from my own freelancing journey.

48
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:57,005
In fact, from the very first freelancing project.

49
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:01,075
I went ahead and created an account on one of the freelancing platforms,

50
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:02,390
set up my profile,

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,190
and started looking for gigs.

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,760
Some work that I could do using the skills I had then.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,635
I approached a few clients,

54
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:13,130
send them expression of interests, not many responded.

55
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,885
One person who did respond wanted to fix a bug in their web application.

56
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:22,135
They were offering me 13 pounds for that job.

57
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,580
Yes, full 13 pounds.

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,160
That doesn't sound like the money you would

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,785
normally take to fix a bug in a web application,

60
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:33,630
which could take pretty long. But you know what?

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,090
I didn't have any other clients at that point and I wanted to try

62
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,090
freelancing out and see if I can get real money in my bank account.

63
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,975
I accepted the offer.

64
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,745
Spent a few hours trying to fix that bug.

65
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:51,515
I tried to put in a good amount of effort trying to help the client debug that bug.

66
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:54,190
I did make 13 pounds from that job,

67
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,255
which was not as important as the review I got from the client on the platform.

68
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:01,610
My first review, I knew I had gotten started.

69
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,915
Now, I got another client on the same platform who was ready to pay me

70
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:10,710
$100 for three days of work. Guess what?

71
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,760
I accepted that too.

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,185
I tried to do a neat job at it.

73
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:20,750
The same client gave me another task which was a little higher and costs,

74
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,180
related to the effort I would spend on it.

75
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,660
I got a few more tasks to do from the same client for which I could

76
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,075
set my own pricing since the client was slowly growing trust in my work.

77
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:35,720
I earned a total of $1,150 from that client,

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,810
who was really the second client in my freelancing carrier.

79
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,380
This money was not small money because I was just getting started and it

80
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,735
meant a lot to me to make something out from my freelancing journey.

81
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,870
I knew I had gotten started.

82
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,550
What do I really want to reiterate with the previous example,

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,820
is that when you are starting off your freelancing carrier,

84
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,150
if you really focus on doing quality work for the clients,

85
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,115
done justified before it,

86
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:03,215
then you could build a good profile,

87
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:07,100
get good reviews, build trust with the existing clients.

88
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,365
Then you can command the rate and the pay that you really deserve.

89
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:15,005
When I started out with that 13 pounds for that first job,

90
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:19,115
a few clients later I could charge $60 an hour,

91
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,950
and later $120 an hour, up till today,

92
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,465
when getting a three-digit hourly rate is quite common.

93
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,245
When we're starting out,

94
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:30,335
it gets more important to do good work.

95
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:32,120
Have happy clients,

96
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,940
and build up a good profile and good reviews.

97
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,120
Sooner than later, you will realize that

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,505
this balance is getting better as your reviews and profile builds up.

99
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:45,290
Keep in mind that along with the reviews,

100
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,620
you're also building up your profile by gaining

101
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,260
more experience and projects to demonstrate your work to other clients.

102
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,355
Let's get back to our original example.

103
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,915
If you happen to have a good profile and good reviews,

104
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:04,060
you are now much better placed to charge a competitive rate.

105
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,555
You have broken the deadlock and can command the rate you deserve.

106
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:11,825
All good things, take time and patience.

107
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:17,580
This time you might be the client's choice despite of your high rate.
