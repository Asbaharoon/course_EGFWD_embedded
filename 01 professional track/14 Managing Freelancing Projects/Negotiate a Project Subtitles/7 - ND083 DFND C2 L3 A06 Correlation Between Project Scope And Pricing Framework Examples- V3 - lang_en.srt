1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,775
Now that we know the correlation between pricing frameworks and project scope,

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,370
we're in a good position to see the pros and

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,505
cons of the two pricing frameworks we discussed.

4
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:14,490
First, let's take a look at the positives and

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,675
the negatives of using fixed cost as a pricing structure.

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:23,715
First, is that the client can really lock in their budget for the project.

7
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,940
They don't need to worry about things going over budget

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,810
as long as the scope of the project remains the same.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,275
It also helps the freelancer to lock in

10
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:38,290
a guaranteed amount that they can make from the project.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,720
Next, indirect benefit from using a fixed cost approach is that there is

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,985
a thorough documentation of what we are going to work on before we start to work.

13
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:54,395
This often helps both the client and the freelancer to

14
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:58,850
think through what really needs to get done in granular details,

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,140
and also helps question our original assumptions about the end goal.

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,305
On the other hand,

17
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:10,565
the flexibility to change things is very limited in a fixed cost project.

18
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,700
For example, if the client wants to involve the scope

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,870
of one particular module or add a new module,

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,750
the fixed cost needs to be recalculated by the freelancer based on

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,225
the extra effort needed and get a sign-off from the client to change it for the project.

22
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:29,495
If this happens multiple times during the course of the project,

23
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,910
it can become quite tedious for the project,

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,650
especially if there are contracts involved.

25
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,820
Let me give an example from my own experience.

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,520
I had sent a shot expression of interests to

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,775
a client who belonged to a big multinational company.

28
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:47,270
The client had sent a specification of what they wanted to get

29
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,850
built with a suggested price of $2,500.

30
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,505
When I looked at the specification which was at a high level,

31
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:58,460
I suggested to them that based on the effort involved,

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,850
it seems to be at least $6,000 but we'll need to make

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,085
the requirements much more specific to quote an exact estimate.

34
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,075
Also while I was talking to them,

35
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:12,895
I did not lose the opportunity to talk about their aspects of the project.

36
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:18,640
I suggested solutions, different ways in which we can build their solution,

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,000
different optimizations that we can do to the recurrent infrastructure.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,250
To cut the long story short,

39
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,370
the requirements could not be specified in detail eventually,

40
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,830
and I did get the project at an hourly rate.

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,825
Now, as we walked along,

42
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:35,075
their requirements kept on changing,

43
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,805
new modules were added.

44
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:38,070
Some things were changed,

45
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,350
but then we changed back to

46
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,785
their original form based on how their management wanted it to be.

47
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,525
Based on the time spent,

48
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:48,050
I ended up charging around $17,500 to

49
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,220
the client which they had originally estimated at $2,500,

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,875
with a not so detailed requirements spec.

51
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,935
I also got more projects from the same client

52
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:01,900
totaling my revenue to $50,000 from the same client.

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,300
Now, let's look at the positives and the negatives of

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,420
using time and material as the pricing structure.

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,480
First, the biggest advantage is

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,470
that the scope can evolve during the course of the project.

57
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,335
If the client changes their mind after looking at the first module,

58
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:21,155
they're free to change the design of the second module,

59
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:26,695
or even completely remove the second module and go right to the third one, and so on.

60
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:32,205
There's no locking order front commitment here in the time and materials contract.

61
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:35,210
If the client is not happy with the freelancers work,

62
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,690
or you as a freelancer is not happy with the client's work culture or the paperwork,

63
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,760
either party is free to leave the project after

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,755
settling the payment based on the time taken to do the work so far.

65
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,450
Honestly, unless you really have to,

66
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,660
it's not a good idea to leave any client's project in

67
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,245
between even if you do not have a contractual obligation.

68
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:00,650
Remember, if you focus on maximizing the value for the client,

69
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,040
it will pay you in the long run.

70
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,645
Now, since the scope is not fixed,

71
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,250
the client does not have to sign

72
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,535
new contracts every time they make a change in the project,

73
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:13,895
or if they have you started on entirely new project.

74
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,070
Since it is a time and material contract,

75
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,370
or an early model contract and it's often called,

76
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,000
the obligation is to pay based on the time irrespective of the work done.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,350
But take that with a pinch of salt.

78
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,825
If the client hires you to build a web app,

79
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:33,965
they cannot have you make a rocket to go to the moon at the same rate.

80
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:36,700
Even in the time and material pricing frameworks,

81
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,165
a very high level scope of work is generally agreed upon.

82
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,270
Again, the downside of time and materials

83
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,860
framework is that there is no upper limit on the budget.

84
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,105
Client's budget can keep going higher and higher as the project moves.

85
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:56,525
With some clients may not be quite comfortable with,

86
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,280
but as we discussed earlier,

87
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,740
some projects may have a cap on the number of hours that you can spend on the project.

88
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,800
But that's said, the work that can be done in these hours is not fixed.

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,650
If the client wants to get more work done and the cap is done with,

90
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,480
they mainly do increase their budget.

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,480
An interesting downside of the time and

92
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,940
material pricing structure is that if you are highly skilled in your area of expertise,

93
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,355
it may not be very efficient for you.

94
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:29,509
For example, you might be able to do something in 15 minutes,

95
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:33,730
which an averagely skilled freelancer may take more than an hour to complete.

96
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,770
Fifteen minutes of your time may not earn

97
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,655
enough revenue for you but it could be a lot of value for the client.

98
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:43,340
But since you are paid based on the time spend,

99
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,830
you only get paid for those 15 minutes.
