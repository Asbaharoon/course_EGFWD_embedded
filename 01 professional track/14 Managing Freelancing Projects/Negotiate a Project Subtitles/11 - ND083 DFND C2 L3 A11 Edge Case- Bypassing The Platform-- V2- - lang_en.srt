00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,545
When we are working via a freelancing platform with a client, in some cases,

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:07,350
the client may reach out to you to bypass

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,135
the platform and just to direct payment from their bank account to yours.

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:17,745
This is usually done to avoid the platform fee and just engage directly.

5
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,870
This might be very lucrative for you as a freelancer as well,

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,455
but it's surely not a good idea in more ways than one.

7
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:30,945
First of all, it is unethical and illegal to bypass the platform.

8
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:34,440
You accept the terms of the platform when you sign up,

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,720
which locks you into the platform for

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,095
transactions with any clients that you find on the platform,

11
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,790
unless the client buys you out by giving a one-time fee,

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,880
which is usually quite high.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,670
Thirdly, you'll see yourself losing trust of the client by doing so,

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,990
even if the client says to do that in the first place.

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,660
After all, if one can cheat the platform,

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,665
nothing stops them from cheating the client as well.

17
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:02,945
Then you put yourself in a very dangerous position,

18
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:06,160
since now the client can pay you on his own terms

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,730
and there is no intermediary to manage disputes.

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,600
Lastly, if you are ethical in your working and thinking,

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,480
client will definitely respect that in the long term.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,710
Not to mention, the satisfaction you will achieve of doing the right thing.
