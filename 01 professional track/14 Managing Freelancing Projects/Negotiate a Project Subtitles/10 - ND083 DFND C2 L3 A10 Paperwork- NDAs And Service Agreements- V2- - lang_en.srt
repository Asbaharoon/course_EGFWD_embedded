1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Now, when a client engages a freelancer,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,355
they may share a lot of information about their work and company with the freelancer.

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:12,915
This information could be things like source code of a software application,

4
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,540
their long-term or short-term business plans,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,310
a design of their product,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,750
even their passwords, their secret source of a key product.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,570
This information may be shared with

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,950
different methods through emails or verbally in meetings,

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,635
through chats, even WhatsApp or Slack,

10
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:35,670
and in some cases shared Cloud drives.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,240
In this case, it becomes really important for

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,980
the client to protect the information and make

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,745
sure that the freelancer takes utmost care to not

14
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:51,380
transmit this information to a third party without the client approving it.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,060
That's what a non-disclosure agreement really is.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,980
It's a legal document to ascertain that

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,610
the freelancer does not transfer any information obtained

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,490
from the client to any third party without

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,990
proper purpose and proper authorization as required.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,630
On the other hand, a service agreement is more about the work that you do.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,120
It's a legal document that lists down the terms of engagement between the two of you.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,355
Examples of things that one might include here are interim delivery schedules,

23
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:27,230
frequency of code drops,

24
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,210
or weekly update schedules,

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,815
working with companies that might work in the same domain as the client,

26
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,905
hiring employees that work for the client,

27
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:40,925
and also terminating the contract prematurely.

28
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:44,810
Sometimes, if things go wrong and you are held liable,

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,080
the contracts may allow unlimited liability,

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,125
which means you may need to pay an indefinite amount to cover the losses.

31
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,950
This is not a good idea,

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,870
especially when you're starting out.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,515
It is always a good idea to limit your liability.

34
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:04,640
A good idea to limit your liability is to limit it to

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,820
a monetary amount of the all the service fee that you receive from the client.

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,855
Another one is indemnification.

37
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,515
Indemnification happens when you need to

38
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:19,010
compensate the client for a breach in the contract.

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,130
Now you know the world is not fair and there's

40
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,309
a rare chance that you might get into a situation,

41
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:29,795
but the client wrongly put charges on you and you'll need to indemnify.

42
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:32,585
This is not common and is very rare.

43
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,130
But if it does happen,

44
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,135
it could lead to significant monetary losses.

45
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:40,775
To mitigate the risk of any such unexpected situations,

46
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,460
it is a good idea to limit the extent of

47
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,930
indemnification to the sum of all the fee that the client paid you.

48
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,785
For example, if the client sues you for a million dollars and they

49
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:55,985
paid you $20,000 for everything that you did for them,

50
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:59,725
you only owe them $20,000 in the lawsuit.

51
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:02,870
It's also important to make sure that contracts like

52
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,590
non-disclosure agreements do not have unlimited validity.

53
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,560
A five-year period from the end of the contract is

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,945
a good time frame to limit the validity, which means,

55
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:16,190
you'll be obligated to the non-disclosure agreement until

56
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,825
five years after the contract has ended and not more than that.

57
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:26,615
Lastly, it is important to put in a premature termination clause there.

58
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,810
You don't want to get stuck with a client if you don't like

59
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,800
the nature of work or you don't like the client's work culture.

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Having a premature termination clause with

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,090
enough notice period is good for a healthy exit from any client relationship.
