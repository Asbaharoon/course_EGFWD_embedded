1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Now let's take a look at a sample project scope and how it may look like.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,350
Now it's important to keep in mind here that

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,010
project scopes vary significantly in their formats and depth.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,395
The details required may vary depending on the client and the nature of work.

5
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:20,875
Now let's start by talking about some key elements in a project scope.

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,585
We start off by defining the end goal of the project,

7
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:29,745
which in this example is a WordPress website for a business consultancy firm.

8
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,670
Then a project scope may also include a deadline,

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,400
when the client wants the project to be done.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,895
A primary part of a project scope is the list of features or the work streams required.

11
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:46,235
In this case, the client has mentioned the sections they want in the website,

12
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:47,615
a live chat,

13
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:52,780
they also need an appointment scheduler and a module to send emails to users.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,285
The client also wants an SSL security certificate,

15
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,145
so the website can be accessed by using the HTTPS protocol.

16
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:04,490
You see these features will really give you an idea of the effort involved,

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,830
what questions you need to ask the clients,

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,625
the sequence of what modules to build first and so on.

19
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:14,150
Now, another important part of a project scope is

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,975
the detailed specification of each individual feature.

21
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:20,240
Just the name of the feature may not give

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,050
a clear picture on what the client really wants to get done.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,850
For example, here the project scope expands on the sections,

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,120
saying that all the content will be provided by the client,

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,285
but the design and the images need to be worked on by the developer.

26
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:39,495
In the appointment scheduler,

27
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,500
the project scope specifies how the user will book

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,295
an appointment and the kind of emails that need to be sent out.

29
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,775
This tells the developer that an email module is needed,

30
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,990
which would increase the amount of effort involved.

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,145
Now, these are some really basic elements that would indeed go and do a project score.

32
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:00,980
As mentioned earlier, the format and depth of

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,795
a project scope could vary from project to project and client to client.

34
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:10,070
For example, a project scope could include the cost and

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,470
the pricing structure of the project or

36
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,589
how periodically the status updates are scheduled.

37
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:18,125
Larger projects have milestone delivery,

38
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,930
which means interim versions of the output are delivered

39
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,515
at specific intervals instead of one delivery at the end.

40
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:28,075
Those milestones could be included in the scope.

41
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,020
In a large organization,

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,470
even the names of the team members are included in the scope.

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,420
These team members are those whom the freelancer needs

44
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,590
to interact with depending on their job function.

45
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,100
Sometimes, external or internal dependencies

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,895
may be included that could affect the project.

47
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:50,525
For example, module set need to be provided by another business unit,

48
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:55,030
which are a prerequisite for us to make progress on our module.

49
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,235
That said, the intent of the project scope,

50
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:01,925
as we discussed earlier, is mainly twofold.

51
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,760
The end goal of the project and

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,780
the building blocks that are required by the client to reach the end goal.
