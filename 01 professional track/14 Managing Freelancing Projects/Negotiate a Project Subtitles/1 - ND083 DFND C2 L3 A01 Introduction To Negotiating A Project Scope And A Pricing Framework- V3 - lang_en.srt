1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,690
In the previous lesson, we talked about where

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,210
to look for clients and how to apply to work for them.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,410
Now, in this lesson,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,235
we will talk about what happens when a client has indeed got an interested in us,

5
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:16,035
and it's trying to walk on the finite details before starting work.

6
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:19,500
Now, let's look at our freelancing journey with the client,

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,265
and what this specific lesson is about in that journey.

8
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:28,320
So far, we discussed about finding clients and sending what

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,780
we call expression of interests to them to increase our chances of getting work.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,890
Now, once the client has shown interest in working with us and has

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,610
also finalized the contract to start working with us,

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,120
we can go ahead and start managing the project until completion.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,320
But even before we do that,

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,765
there is an important phase in between,

15
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:56,230
where we discuss the scope and the appropriate pricing framework with the client.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,610
As you go through this lesson,

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,155
you will learn how important this phase can be in a freelancing project.

18
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:07,235
The more specific the details are on scope and pricing framework,

19
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,640
the smoother will your project be later.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,405
Let's take a look at what we will cover in this lesson.

21
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:19,070
First, we start out by discussing what do we mean by scoping

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,115
the project and best practices to scope a project before we started.

23
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,900
We will also discuss the common types of

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,560
pricing frameworks and how to figure out the best fit,

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,785
keeping the client in mind and the correlation between the scope and the pricing.

26
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:40,520
Then we'll talk about how to set a rate and

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,215
fixed costs when you start out your freelancing carrier.

28
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:49,280
Then we'll touch upon non-disclosure agreements and service agreements,

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,875
and how to avoid usual pitfalls before starting a project.

30
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,425
Lastly, we'll discuss an edge case,

31
00:01:57,425 --> 00:02:00,110
a situation that is less common in

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,340
a regular freelancing project and best practice to deal with it.

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,305
By the end of this lesson,

34
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,480
you'll be able to work with the client,

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,295
to create the project scope by applying freelancing best practices.

36
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:16,820
Determine the pricing framework by deciding between

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,260
fixed cost or time and materials contract based on client needs.

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,740
Lastly, you'll be able to formalize the initiation of the project,

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,260
including any non-disclosure agreements or service agreements involved in the project.
