1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
Now at this point,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,345
we know what is a project scope and what is a pricing framework.

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:08,910
In this important part of the lesson,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,140
we'll talk about a correlation that exists between these two.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,980
It is important to understand how the scope and

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,530
the pricing framework of the project go hand in hand and are really interdependent.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,950
Let's say we're trying to determine the fixed cost;

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,060
the overall cost of a project that we want to charge the client.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,980
When we do that, first,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,445
we need to figure out what we're really trying to achieve here.

11
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:37,545
What is our end goal?

12
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:41,370
For example, we might be trying to build a web application,

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,590
or an Android application,

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,780
or a digital marketing solution,

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,035
to increase traffic on the website.

16
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:51,995
Now once we have determined what the end goal of the project is,

17
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:56,180
we want to get in a little deeper and find out what exactly are

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,815
the different features or tasks required to complete the project to achieve the goal.

19
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:07,160
For example, we may need an authentication module

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,390
as a feature of the web application or a social media campaign,

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,860
maybe around the tasks,

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,040
or work streams in a digital marketing solution.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,940
But we don't stop there.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,800
To figure out how much we'd charge the client,

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,740
we need to go a little bit more deeper and

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,100
draft a specification for each of these features.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,500
For example, an authentication module may need

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,265
a forgot password feature in case the user forgets their password,

29
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:36,515
a way to sign up new users,

30
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:39,680
keep the user session active for a fixed time.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,950
A social media campaign on the other hand may involve

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,135
further details like which platforms will the campaign be running on,

33
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,015
how many posts per day will we be posting?

34
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:54,350
Which define how much we need to prepare for these posts.

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,065
What kind of posts, image,

36
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:59,765
or text? How many contests?

37
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,990
What is the duration of the campaign?

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,615
All of these details are really critical in figuring out

39
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:11,275
the total effort that we need to spend as a freelancer to work on that task.

40
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:13,280
Once we have the total effort,

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,260
we can then estimate how much we want to charge the client for that much work.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,095
Now let's say if we knew the goal,

43
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:24,680
could we then estimate a fixed costs for the project?

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,850
We will not be able to do that since we do not know how

45
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,710
complex or sophisticated are the features that the client needs to fulfill the goal,

46
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,630
which will define how much effort we spend on it.

47
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,029
Could we do it if we have all the features,

48
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,495
but not the detailed specifications?

49
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,230
Still we won't be able to,

50
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,715
because the devil is in the details and the effort required for

51
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:53,875
each feature really depends on what goes in that feature,

52
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,635
so we really need a detailed scope of the project.

53
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:03,680
The detailed scope helps us determine the total effort that needs to be spent,

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,570
which further determines the total cost of the project.

55
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,650
That is why the pricing structure is dependent on the scope of the project.

56
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,330
If the scope is not defined in detail we will not be able to

57
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,930
come up with a fixed cost for the project end to end.
