1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,915
Now, let's look into the common pricing frameworks

2
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:05,780
that are used in the freelancing world.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,325
Now, by pricing framework here,

4
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:14,370
what we mean is the structure within which you as a freelancer would get paid.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,400
The two types that we discussed now would make this clearer.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,520
One kind of pricing framework is called fixed cost.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,125
As the name suggests,

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,050
this means that the total cost of the project

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,490
end-to-end is fixed at the start of the project.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:36,500
For example, you could say that you charge $100 to add a module to an existing website,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,745
or you would charge $400 to build a static website,

12
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:44,725
or maybe $3,000 to build a web application.

13
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:47,840
All these are fixed costs for the project

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,775
that you have decided to work on for the client.

15
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:56,134
Then the client will pay you after the work is completed.

16
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:59,225
All these are fixed costs for the project

17
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,845
that the client will pay you after the work is done.

18
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,650
On the other hand,

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,565
time and material is the other pricing framework

20
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:11,075
which requires a fixed rate for the work that you do.

21
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:14,875
This rate is usually set as an hourly rate.

22
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:19,295
For example, you could set your rate to $25 an hour,

23
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:25,585
which means you'll get $25 for every hour that you spend working on the client's task,

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,615
or $40 an hour,

25
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:30,855
or maybe $110 an hour.

26
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:35,265
Fixed-cost project is primarily work-based,

27
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:40,240
you get paid for the work that you have done whose cost is pre-decided.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,825
On the other hand, as we saw,

29
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:45,690
time and material is time-based,

30
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,525
you are paid based on the time you spend on the task.

31
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,215
Keep in mind though,

32
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:56,875
that some projects may put a cap on the maximum number of hours that you can spend there.

33
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,040
But what gets done in those hours cannot be fixed since this is

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,070
a time-based model where you are paid for the time you spend on the project.

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,650
If you're thinking about what's the material bid in time and material,

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,080
that's the next point of difference.

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,210
In fixed cost, the cost is inclusive of any overheads that are required for the project.

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,170
You would not build them separately since the total cost of the project

39
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,435
is already fixed and the client has already budgeted for it.

40
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:30,270
Whereas in time and material,

41
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,610
you will build any overheads on actuals to the client since it is not

42
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,745
a fixed cost project and you're billing for any time

43
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:41,915
or material that you use for the project as you go along.

44
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:46,030
Now, what do we really mean by overheads, you might ask.

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,080
Overheads are things like any special hardware that you use for the project,

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,025
like a webcam when you're developing an image sensing application,

47
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:59,875
or any specific software license that you need to obtain for the client's project,

48
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,600
like Microsoft Word license to create and edit

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,365
documents or a paid WordPress stream for a website.

50
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:09,530
We discussed the two kinds of pricing structures that are

51
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,170
generally used by freelancers to build their clients.

52
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,610
I would say spend some time to look at these two types of

53
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,170
pricing structures in this chart and try to internalize them.

54
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,340
You'll see these coming handy whenever you work with new clients.
