1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Now, let's take a few simple examples of three different clients.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,040
The first client here has a project proposal which is

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,000
not fully defined yet and is slowly unfolding over time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,375
The second has a well-defined goal for the project,

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,405
but the granular features are non-defined.

6
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,030
The third has the goal,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,010
has the features well-defined,

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,460
but there is a high chance that all the requirements will

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,515
evolve and the features might get changed or new ones might get added.

10
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:33,795
In all of these three cases,

11
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:38,210
a fixed cost pricing structure is not really a good idea for

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,685
the simple reason that the scope is either not known fully or is likely to change,

13
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:47,680
hence the time and material structure is better suited here.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,675
The client only pays for the time that the developer spends

15
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:56,250
and is free to change the requirements as they evolve for the client.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,010
If you remember our pricing framework slide,

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,905
where we introduced the two types of pricing frameworks,

18
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:05,220
it would be worth adding yet another point here;

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,480
that the scope is well-defined in a fixed cost framework,

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,420
whereas it may not be as well-defined

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,840
in a project with time and materials pricing structure.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,020
Another important aspect of deciding a pricing structure at

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,590
the start of the project is that when you're discussing this with the client,

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,440
they may not even know about the structures at all.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,075
You as a freelancer,

26
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:32,025
need to subtly lay down the options before the client for them to choose from.

27
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,810
The client would most likely be like,

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,190
"I want to get a website built,

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,810
how much would it cost?"

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,490
You as a freelancer,

31
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,520
need to walk them through the different pricing structures

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,090
and also get a sense of what kind of website they need to get built.

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,130
While you're doing that, remember that focus on the maximizing the value of the client,

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,165
try to put yourself in the client's shoes and see what the client's priorities are,

35
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:59,680
and try to align yourself with those priorities while deciding these pricing structures.
