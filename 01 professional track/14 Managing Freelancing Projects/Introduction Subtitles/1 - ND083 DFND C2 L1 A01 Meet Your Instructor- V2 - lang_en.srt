Hello, my name is [inaudible] and I'll be

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,090
your instructor for this course on managing freelancing projects.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,890
I run a software startup,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,280
which is a social enterprise where we crunch a lot of data about

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,300
social impact and projects for the underprivileged communities in India.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,470
I started my freelancing journey about five years ago when I was just

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,165
launching my startup since I needed money on the site to sustain my company.

8
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:29,070
We have also hired freelancers to work for our startup in various roles.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,795
I take a lot of decisions,

10
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:34,050
even big decisions with my heart and not much with mind,

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,870
and I realized that the power of our intuition can

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,710
take us really far in the personal and professional world.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,550
I've worked with 90 plus clients from all over

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,390
the world and have had amazing learnings from this freelancing journey,

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,080
which has enabled me to not only run my startup but also be

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,060
able to hire freelancers and help their livelihoods.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,530
I'm a practitioner of heartfulness meditation and provide

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,450
free meditations to anyone who is willing to explore meditation.

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,310
I'd say, get used to my face because you are stuck with me for the rest of the course.
