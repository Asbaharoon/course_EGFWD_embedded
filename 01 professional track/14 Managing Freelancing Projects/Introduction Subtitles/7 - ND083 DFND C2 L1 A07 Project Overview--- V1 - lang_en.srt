1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Now at the end of this course,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,240
you'll be responsible for completing a project.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,190
The goals of the project are for you to be able

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,380
to implement what we learned in this course.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:18,150
To ultimately find and apply for freelance jobs by creating a process to source clients.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,500
Use best practices to go through a project scope and choose a pricing framework,

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,950
aligning with clients' needs.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,400
Manage projects by maximizing value for the client.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,790
Finally, formally closing out a project and secure payments.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,440
During the project, you will work with

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,130
a mock client to practice the initial communication stages.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:52,160
Learn how to manage the client's project by utilizing the project management process,

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,110
through a tool called Trello,

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,715
as well as setting up project milestones.

15
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,565
Invoicing your client.

16
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:03,515
This will get you comfortable with interacting with clients,

17
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:06,380
as well as going through project stages,

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,030
from initial communication to final payment.

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,675
Now the project will require you to read a project listing,

20
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:19,885
write an initial expression of interests message to a client,

21
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:22,805
set up a project management process,

22
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:27,335
create a Trello board with outlined project milestones.

23
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:33,660
Finally, invoice the client by using a provided invoicing template.
