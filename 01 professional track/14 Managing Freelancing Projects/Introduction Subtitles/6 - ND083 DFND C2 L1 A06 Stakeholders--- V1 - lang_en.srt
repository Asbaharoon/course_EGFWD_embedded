00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
Now let's take a look at the key stakeholders in a freelancing ecosystem.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,810
Let's start with you, the freelancer,

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:17,145
who has a skill that can be used for clients' projects and ready to take on work.

4
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:25,155
The other is the client who is looking to get a specific task done through a freelancer.

5
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:29,985
Now, a client could either be an individual or a company.

6
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:37,755
It is also common for large companies to hire freelancers to get short-term tasks done.

7
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:41,780
Many times, there is also an intermediary involved,

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,140
which connects the client and the freelancer,

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,530
helps them find each other,

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,655
and in some cases also manage payments, etc.

11
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:55,190
Now, examples of these intermediaries would be

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,010
freelancing platforms that we will cover in detail in this course,

13
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,930
or job sites, which not only advertise

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,010
full-time jobs but also short-term freelancing positions.
