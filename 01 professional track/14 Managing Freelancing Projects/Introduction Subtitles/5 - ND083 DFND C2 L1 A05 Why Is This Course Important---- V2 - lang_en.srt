00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When you step into the freelancing world,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,300
you'll realize that it's very different from a full-time job.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,875
In a full-time job,

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,510
things are pretty defined.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,340
Your job role is defined.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,835
Your responsibilities are more or less articulated.

7
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,515
In a freelancing world,

8
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,075
it is an open field.

9
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:21,675
There are so many clients out there who need to get work done.

10
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,295
But how to find them?

11
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:25,020
Where are those clients?

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,125
What strategies to adopt to win a project from clients?

13
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,240
How to work with them effectively?

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,720
In this course, the intent is not only to help you with all of

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,115
these changes in freelancing but also to bootstrap your freelancing carrier.

16
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:41,770
For those of you who are just starting out a freelancing carrier,

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,430
you will see that it might be hard to get your first few gigs since you do not

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,325
have much in your profile to show to other clients or testimonials from other clients.

19
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,330
We'll discuss how to break this deadlock,

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,875
bootstrap your freelancing carrier and sooner than later,

21
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,830
be able to obtain a competitive freelancing profile,

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,665
so it is not so difficult to get new clients.

23
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:09,680
The best part, all of this course is based on learnings from practical experience.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,270
You'll see yourself going through

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,840
many scenarios throughout the course that you might face in

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,140
real life and will compel you to think on

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,470
how to deal with a variety of situations. All the best.
