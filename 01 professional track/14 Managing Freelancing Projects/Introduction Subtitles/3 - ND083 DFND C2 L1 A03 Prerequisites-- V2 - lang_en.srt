1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
Let's start with an understanding of what this course is about and what it's not about.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,840
One example of what this course is about is that here we will talk

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,010
about strategies to build up a good freelancing profile.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,470
Some best practices to find work from clients when we're starting out.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,435
Strategies to work sustainably with clients.

6
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:28,995
Think of this course to be about kickstarting your freelancing career,

7
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:33,570
how to get those first few clients and best practices,

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,670
tips and tricks to walk through as you continue in your freelancing journey.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,965
Different tools and platforms that are used.

10
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:47,200
Real-life scenarios in a freelancing journey and how to deal with each of those.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,975
But here we won't be talking about things like what is freelancing or its pros and cons,

12
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:59,330
because it is assumed that we already have a basic understanding of what is freelancing.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,205
We will also not go through

14
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:05,300
the logistical details of each freelancing platform individually,

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,580
and would generally talk about the basics of

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,900
a freelancing platform that would be handy for you when you work with any platform.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,530
Now, let's quickly take a look at what do we need to know before we take on this course.

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,605
First, we need to know the fundamentals of digital freelancing.

19
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:25,765
What is freelancing and how it is different from a full-time job.

20
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:29,090
Second, and the most important is that we need to

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,410
have a skill that we can use to get work from clients.

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,910
For example, you could build a website for

23
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,315
a client or you could provide a digital marketing solution.

24
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:42,800
You could also get an idea of the marketable skills that are popular by looking at some

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,315
of the freelancing platforms that we will cover in detail in this course.

26
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,850
Since you'll mostly be working remotely,

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,180
it's good to have a stable Internet connection so you can have

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,675
audio or video calls with clients comfortably,

29
00:01:56,675 --> 00:02:00,545
and also be able to use online collaboration tools.

30
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:03,515
Since you will be mostly conversing in English,

31
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,350
it's good to be able to speak and write English.

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,990
It will also help if you can work on

33
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:14,585
Microsoft Office products like Microsoft Word and Excel, or Google Workspace.

34
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,300
Tools like Google Docs or Google Sheets,

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,620
since they may be quite handy when working with clients on projects,

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,280
documents, or service agreements.

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,500
Finally, it is recommended that you have completed

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,629
one Nanodegree through Udacity with at least two projects successfully passed.
