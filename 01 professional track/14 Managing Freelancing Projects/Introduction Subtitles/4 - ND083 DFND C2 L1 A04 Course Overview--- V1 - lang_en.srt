00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Currently, we are in the introduction phase of

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,460
this course and I'm sure you are curious about what the course is going to cover.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,220
Let's go over each lesson in the course at

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,055
a high level and what we are going to learn there.

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,670
As you can see, the lessons in the course are going to follow

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,510
a typical freelancing project journey. Let's get going.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,720
We'll start with the lesson on sourcing clients,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,380
how and where to find clients to work with.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,990
We'll also do a deeper dive into freelancing platforms and how we can

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,650
apply to work on client's projects by sending them a brief expression of interest.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,540
Then we'll talk about things to discuss with

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,065
the client before we formally start a project with them,

13
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:48,065
things like project scope and pricing frameworks.

14
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:52,685
Also any non-disclosure or service agreements that we need to sign.

15
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:56,585
We'll then talk about strategies to manage projects

16
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:00,535
with the discussion on project management tools like Trello.

17
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:04,490
Finally, we'll discuss best practices to formally close

18
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,000
out a project maintaining a good relationship with the client.
