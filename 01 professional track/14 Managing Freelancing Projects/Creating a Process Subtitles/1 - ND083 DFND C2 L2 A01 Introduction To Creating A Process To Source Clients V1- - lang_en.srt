1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
In this lesson, we'll be talking about creating a process to source clients.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,225
Now let's take a look at what that really means.

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:12,105
Now, as we discussed in the last lesson,

4
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:16,350
there are primarily two parties in a freelancing ecosystem.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,255
One is the freelancer,

6
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:21,840
which is you, and the other is the client.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,230
Now there are lots of clients out there who are looking

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,755
for freelancers like you to get their task done.

9
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,570
But the question is,

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,935
how to find those clients and how can they find you?

11
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,290
That is what we will cover in this lesson.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,375
Apart from that, we will also talk about strategies of how to win a client.

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,250
Meaning, how can you apply to work on

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,740
the freelancing project to increase your chances of actually getting that project.

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,530
Now that we've gone through the introduction of the course,

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,170
let's start with the very first step in

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,770
our freelancing journey of finding clients to work for.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:09,005
But before that, let's take a look at what we'll cover in this lesson at a high level.

19
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:16,140
First, we'll start with setting a mindset to adopt when starting a freelancing career,

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,890
which would make it quite helpful to go through

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,955
the rest of the lesson and this entire course.

22
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:27,700
Next, we will discuss the different channels available out there to source clients,

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,285
where to find clients that you can work with.

24
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,910
Then we'll dive a little bit deeper,

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,910
specifically into freelancing platforms,

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,210
which are a great way to find clients when you are starting a freelancing career.

27
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,879
Starting with the introduction,

28
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,705
we'll discuss profile creation and platform walkthrough.

29
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:50,440
Next, we'll discuss sending what we call

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,430
an expression of interest to work on a client request on these platforms.

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,010
Not only that, we'll discuss strategies to send a winning expression of

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,975
interest to increase your chances of getting the task to work on.

33
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:09,415
Lastly, we'll quickly summarize what we went through in the lesson.

34
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:14,665
Let's take a look now at what we will be able to do by the end of this lesson.

35
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:21,020
First, we'll be able to utilize freelancing platforms to find new clients.

36
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,080
Second, we'll be able to create a profile on a freelancing platform.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,800
Then as discussed earlier,

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,650
we'll be able to send an expression of interest

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,740
to apply to work on a client request by adopting

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,530
strategies discussed in this lesson that could

41
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,920
increase our chances of getting the project to work on.
