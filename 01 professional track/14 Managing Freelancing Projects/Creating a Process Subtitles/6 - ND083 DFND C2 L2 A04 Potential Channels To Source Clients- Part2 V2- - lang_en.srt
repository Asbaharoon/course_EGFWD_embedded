1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,955
Now let's look at the positives and negatives

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:07,180
of using social media as a channel to find clients.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:13,440
Primary advantage of social media is that it is more trusted than other avenues,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,669
like a freelancing platform or public forums, etc.

5
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:20,295
It's your social network.

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:25,050
Either forks that you are directly connected with like friends and family and

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,765
folks that are connected with your data connections like friends of friends, etc.

8
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:35,630
A client would be more comfortable working with someone they already

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,480
know or was referred by someone they

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,785
know as compared to working with a complete stranger.

11
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:44,655
Same goes with you as a freelancer.

12
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:48,630
Now if you find someone to work with through your own social network,

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,030
there is no intermediary involved who helped you find them,

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,920
which means no intermediary fee like

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,300
a platform fee that comes with freelancing platforms.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,810
One unique thing about social media is that you'll find a bunch of domain

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,250
specific groups that you could subscribe to in order to find work.

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,990
For example, if you're a Python developer you could just join a Python Facebook group,

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,920
or if you are a digital marketing consultant you

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,085
can join a digital marketing freelancers group on LinkedIn.

21
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:22,460
This could give you access to specific clients who are

22
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,215
interested specifically in your area of work.

23
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:30,020
That said, if you are working with someone whom you found on

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,740
a social media platform and if there is a dispute, for example,

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,145
disagreement on the scope at a later point in the project,

26
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,860
payment defaults and so on,

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,870
now since there is no intermediary,

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,530
you are on your own to resolve those disputes.

29
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:51,335
Sometimes this may lead to loss of time and money due to lack of an intermediary to help.

30
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:55,505
Lastly, also you can find good clients from within your network,

31
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:57,770
social media is a free for all.

32
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,290
You might find many non-serious clients as well on an open platform like this,

33
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,810
who may not be serious enough to work on

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,170
a project or may not even have the funds to pay for it.

35
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,040
You won't find this drawback on platforms which are meant for

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,345
freelancing and have clients that are rated to some extent.

37
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,270
Now let's look at the positives and negatives of

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,200
using networks as a channel to find clients.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,055
Now, as we discussed earlier,

40
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:28,970
by networks here we basically mean, your closed network.

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,830
People that you directly know.

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,264
Your family, friends, ex colleagues,

43
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:38,430
that guy you meet at the coffee shop sometimes, and so on.

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,840
As with social media,

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,570
this is your trusted network that you

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,895
or the client would be more comfortable to work with.

47
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,300
Since this is your close network,

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,715
there is a higher level of trust which means that you can get long-term projects.

49
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:58,495
Now when you get a lead through your network,

50
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:01,075
it may not be an advertised assignment.

51
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:04,690
Someone you know, might just be looking for someone like you to

52
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,870
work on their project and they may not have advertised it widely.

53
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,245
Hence, there may be less or

54
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:15,895
no competition increasing the probability of you getting the project.

55
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,640
As in social media,

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,170
if there is a disagreement between the two parties

57
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,540
on things like project's scope or payments,

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,830
there is no intermediary to mediate.

59
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,635
You're on your own to resolve the dispute.

60
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:31,535
Hence, it is important to proceed with caution here,

61
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:33,950
since any disputes may also affect

62
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,600
your long-term relationship with a client who is a part of your network.

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Lastly, since you are tapping your network,

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
your options are really limited.

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,300
You may be lucky to find someone in your network who is

66
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,150
looking for someone with your skills,

67
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,930
since your network is limited to people whom you already know.

68
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,975
Which isn't the case with freelancing platforms or social media,

69
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,550
where you'll find lots of clients.

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,190
Now that we know how a freelancing platform achieves its purpose,

71
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,100
let's see what are the positives and negatives of using these freelancing platforms.

72
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,815
Being a marketplace,

73
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:14,690
of course you'll have a lot of clients publishing a lot of requests.

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,760
It's a hub where clients come to get work done.

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,160
You'll have a wide variety of clients and work to

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,670
choose from which match your skills and interest.

77
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,465
Now before you or a client decide to work with each other,

78
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:32,535
both of you can see reviews of each other.

79
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:35,650
Now these reviews are left by other people

80
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,490
who have worked with you or the client in the past.

81
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,310
These reviews are a pretty important feature of any freelancing platform and can

82
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,440
give you a pretty good idea about the client

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,770
or a freelancer before starting to work with them.

84
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,730
[inaudible] is that these platforms will

85
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,590
also manage the payments and we'll resolve any disputes that arise.

86
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,840
For many platforms, the payment for the work is securely kept with the platform

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,255
even before starting the work and is released to the freelancer after the work is done,

88
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,745
which is commonly called as escrow.

89
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,815
Now looking at the downsides,

90
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,685
an important clade off of using these platforms is that they charge a fee.

91
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:24,445
A platform fee which is related to what you earn there at the platform.

92
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:28,790
This platform fee is usually around 15-20 percent,

93
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,845
but could go up or down depending on the terms of the platform.

94
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:36,515
Sometimes platforms are willing to lower this fee for you

95
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:40,855
if you have lots of clients and hence giving good business to them.

96
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,965
Second, and yet,

97
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:47,360
another important downside of a freelancing platform is that there may be

98
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,520
a lot of freelancers applying for each request and so it becomes competitive.

99
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,570
It is important to mention here that some platforms have started

100
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,370
using artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce that competition.

101
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,465
They automatically filter the requests that you see based on your skills,

102
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,810
your read, your history with other clients and so on.

103
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,070
With that list of pros and cons of a freelancing platform, I would say,

104
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,980
overall a freelancing platform is a great place to

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,010
start if you're just starting your freelancing career,

106
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,410
as compared to other channels that we talked about.
