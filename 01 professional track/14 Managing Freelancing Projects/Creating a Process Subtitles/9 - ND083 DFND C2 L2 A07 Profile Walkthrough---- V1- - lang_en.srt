1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Now it would be worthwhile taking a look at

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,350
an existing freelancing profile and go over it's key fields.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,750
This will help us really understand how a typical profile looks like,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,790
and will also deepen our understanding of the kind of content that we can put in here.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,505
First field here is name,

6
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:24,060
straightforward, not enough room to go round there.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,375
Now, usually many freelancing platforms require

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,885
short bios which appear in not only your profile,

9
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,660
but also in different search results when clients are

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,660
looking for freelancers with specific skills,

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,580
and as we discussed earlier,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,555
it is important for these bios to be short and crisp.

13
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,525
Cut to the chase, and get straight to the point.

14
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:52,005
Remember, our typical plan is skimming not reading a profile end-to-end.

15
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,575
In this example of the bio that you see,

16
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,415
you will note that the freelancer has clearly pointed out

17
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:03,515
their core expertise even though their focus areas are more than those.

18
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:08,840
This really helps the client to quickly identify what their core strength is.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,375
Secondly, specifically calling out what you have done for clients in the past

20
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,760
using your core strength gives

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,495
an additional metric to the client about what you can do for them.

22
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:23,120
It also demonstrates your subject knowledge,

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,460
your ability to measure success as

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,715
compared to simply mentioning your scale in the profile.

25
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,685
Third, as we also discussed earlier,

26
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,390
it is okay to put in formal details like a book that you

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,250
provide to clients to start up a conversation with them.

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,005
Clients, especially new clients,

29
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,255
like getting into conversations,

30
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:48,595
warming up before they decide to start spending money.

31
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:51,335
If they see such offer in your bio,

32
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:54,830
they're more likely to contact you since there's nothing to lose,

33
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,000
and you get a chance to talk to a potential client as well about

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,055
solutions to their task or a project with the potential of working with them.

35
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:08,405
Now they would most likely be a skill section in a freelancing profile,

36
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:13,660
which will require you to list down the skills you have along with short descriptions.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,390
Now, it is again important here to be short and crisp.

38
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,395
Call-out significant aspects of your experience with these skills.

39
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,975
For example, as we saw in the bio,

40
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:27,470
quantifying your past success with a specific skill,

41
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,930
not only demonstrates to the client that you can

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,555
actually work using that skill successfully,

43
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:36,140
but it also demonstrates your knowledge in the subject and

44
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,945
your ability to express the result quantifiably.

45
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:45,290
You'll also note that when the freelancer does that for another skill in this profile,

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,885
she also gives the company's name,

47
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,915
and links to their website.

48
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:51,845
It's a great idea to do that,

49
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,950
provided the company does not prohibit to use their name,

50
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,740
and the fact that you have worked for them publicly,

51
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,100
either in service agreement or a non-disclosure agreement.

52
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,555
If you're not restricted,

53
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,570
it's a great idea to put a name,

54
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,575
and a link, because that brings much more credibility to your claim.

55
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,860
Now when you are quantifying the result of an engagement,

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,100
sometimes it might be important to provide the client with

57
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,965
some benchmark for them to evaluate how significant that contribution was.

58
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:24,215
Now for example, look at the third skill here,

59
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:27,430
conversion rate of 2.7 percent.

60
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,605
Now that would probably appear pretty low to a client

61
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,650
who does not know much about online ads.

62
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,780
In fact, there's a high probability that the client does not know about conversions,

63
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,265
which is why they're engaging an expert like you.

64
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:47,420
Now when you give a link in your profile to average conversion rates on Google ads,

65
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,950
and if the client sees that the average is around 2.1 percent,

66
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,840
2.7 starts appearing to be a good conversion rate relatively.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,130
You will see that this kind of education to the client might

68
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,450
be needed even while you are working with the client multiple times,

69
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,020
even without the client asking for it for them to

70
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,920
value your contribution in the larger picture for them.

71
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,265
The client may not know what they don't know.

72
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:19,460
Now another important section in a profile is

73
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,150
generally one that talks about your past experiences.

74
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,845
The projects that you've done,

75
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:27,770
work projects, informal projects.

76
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,520
This section shows what you have done with other clients

77
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,850
in the past and could really help the client in assessing

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,970
the kind of work that you have done in the past so that

79
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,785
they can see if it matches with the work that they have for you.

80
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:44,360
Again, as we discussed earlier,

81
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,715
this two needs to be short and crisp.

82
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:51,505
We don't want to write long paragraphs for each experience or project.

83
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:56,450
Now one thing to point out here is that it is a really good idea to provide

84
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,490
any links to your projects as long as they're not protected by an NDA.

85
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,995
This will give the client direct access to your work and the output of your work.

86
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:10,939
If you're early in your career and don't have much work experience,

87
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,970
link to a personal project could really help in

88
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,390
showing off the kind of work that you can do for the client.
