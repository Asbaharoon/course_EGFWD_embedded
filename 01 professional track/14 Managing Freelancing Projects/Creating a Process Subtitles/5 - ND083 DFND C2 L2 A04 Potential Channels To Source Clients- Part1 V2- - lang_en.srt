00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Now as we discussed earlier,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,390
let's look at the different channels available to find new clients whom you can work for.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,460
First and foremost, social media has always been

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,845
a popular revenue to find new people for personal as well as professional purposes.

5
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,125
For digital freelancing as well,

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,815
it is no different.

7
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:24,110
One can find new clients by just posting about

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,300
their availability to work on projects in their area of expertise.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,670
Even clients use these platforms to advertise

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,335
their requirements in order to find freelancers to work on their projects.

11
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,770
Another and one of the most popular revenues for

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,924
freelancers to find clients are freelancing platforms.

13
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:48,410
These platforms are marketplaces that are specifically

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,125
designed for clients and freelancers to find each other.

15
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:59,670
They not only help with discovery but also help with payments and in disputes, etc.

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,845
Because of the importance of freelancing platforms in the freelancing world,

17
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:08,270
you will see us diving deeper into them later in this lesson.

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,725
Yet another important channel is your own network.

19
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,420
Now by networks here,

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,815
we mean your friends,

21
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:19,580
family, ex-colleagues whom you already know.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,355
It is often said that it is easier to find a full-time job when you tap your network.

23
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:27,140
Even in the freelancing world,

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,360
you'll see that your network could play

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,140
a great role in getting you new clients through referrals.
