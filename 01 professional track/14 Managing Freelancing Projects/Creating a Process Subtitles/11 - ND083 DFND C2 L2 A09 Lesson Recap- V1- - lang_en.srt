00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
Now let's take a quick look at all we covered so far.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,400
We started the lesson with setting a mindset of maximizing value for the client,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,720
and how that is key to a freelancing carrier.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,665
Then we discussed different channels to source clients.

5
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:19,920
Specifically discussed more about freelancing

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,910
platforms which are quite handy in starting a freelancing career.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,980
We learn different aspects of creating

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,520
a profile and walk through a freelancing dashboard.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,205
Lastly, we discussed best practices to send expression of interest to potential clients.

10
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,280
Good job so far.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,485
In the next lesson,

12
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:44,550
we'll discuss what to do when a client does show interest in working with us.
