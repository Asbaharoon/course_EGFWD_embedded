1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,595
Now, let's take a different example.

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:05,010
I was working as a freelance consultant on

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,700
a development project for a client in the Southeast in the US.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,980
I noticed that the client was using the Amazon Cloud to host their application,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,370
and they were paying $500 per month for the hosting.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,995
Now, a simple web app with 500 users doesn't have much infrastructure cost these days,

7
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:24,480
especially on the Cloud.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,170
I noticed that they were using a lot of servers on

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,720
the Cloud that they won't need unless they reach a critical mass of the users,

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,505
maybe like 300,000 users.

11
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:34,665
Unless they reach 300,000 users,

12
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:36,975
they won't need so many servers.

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:40,070
Something like that doesn't have enough value for me to

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,430
fix personally in terms of revenue from the client.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,950
I just need to get on one call and try to explain it to

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,940
the client and they'll take care of the rest in case they're convinced.

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,770
But it would be of immense value to the client if that is fixed.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,590
I made the effort to do that and the client was able to reduce their costs by

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,160
90 percent of what they were paying earlier to the Amazon Cloud.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,625
Even though this was not of significant value to me in terms of revenue,

21
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,740
this deepened clients' trust in me,

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,490
causing them to continue to give work to me at a rate that I was comfortable with.
