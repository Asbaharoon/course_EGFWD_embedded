1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
Now let's discuss a little bit about

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,575
strategies to send winning expression of interests to the client.

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,840
To quickly refresh our memory,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
when a client publishes a task on a freelancing platform,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,950
a freelancer would send an expression of interest to

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,105
the client and express interest in working on that task.

7
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:25,710
Now keep in mind that this is not something long and detailed.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,900
It is a shot text message sent to the client over the platform

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,565
in about 2-4 lines to express interest in working on that task.

10
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:40,130
Now let's look at some of the best practices that

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,925
could be very helpful in winning a project from a client.

12
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:47,630
A lot of these will come naturally to you when you view

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,315
the client's ad and prioritize maximizing value for the client.

14
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:55,820
First of fall, it is important to reiterate

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
the understanding of the problem in your own words,

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,890
in the expression of interest.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,815
That is the very first thing that you should prioritize.

18
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,505
This not only helps with getting on the same page with the client,

19
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:11,030
but it builds trust in the client that you are making an attempt

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,200
to get on the same page and fully grasp the problem at hand.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,835
Now in some cases,

22
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:20,825
if you already have a quick tip for the client to get to the solution,

23
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,640
share it with the client.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
This will assure the client of your understanding of

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,565
the problem and ability to come up with an efficient solution.

26
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:36,080
This could also separate you from other freelancers who may not have a quick tip in

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,690
their expression of interest or who did not

28
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,755
prioritize sharing it with the client at this point.

29
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,695
Now again thinking from the client's point of view,

30
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:50,570
start with the problem statement of the client and not your own credentials.

31
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,740
Instead of saying that you have x years of experience with the clients,

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,765
get straight into the problem statement and how it can be solved.

33
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:02,760
Then backup your claims talking about your skills and experience.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,390
You will soon notice that more clients get back to you with this approach since they got

35
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:14,465
someone who understands their issue and is already thinking about how to solve it.

36
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:16,615
In the end, I would say,

37
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:20,290
consider these as guidelines and not hard rules.

38
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,430
The more clients you work with,

39
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,805
better intuition you will develop to deal with different scenarios.

40
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:28,865
Now, talking what scenarios,

41
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,290
at the end of this section,

42
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,650
we will practice writing some expression of interest for

43
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,525
clients in the exercise that will give us a first-hand experience of it.

44
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:44,045
But before that, let's see some examples of fully written expression of interests.

45
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:47,870
Now take a look at this example of an expression of interests.

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,090
But before we move forward,

47
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,150
I'd encourage you to pause the video here

48
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,095
and just carefully read through this expression of interest.

49
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,960
Think about how the above expression of

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,235
interest covers the best practices that we discussed earlier.

51
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:07,350
You can unpause when you're done.

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,375
Now let's evaluate this expression of interest.

53
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:18,575
We start by reiterating the clients ask at a high level.

54
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:23,060
Are we there? Then we ask a specific question to

55
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,730
the client mentioning the config file name

56
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,340
to check if they already tried working with it.

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,655
This again demonstrates that you know what you're proposing to work on.

58
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:38,210
In the third line, we mention explicitly

59
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,000
about our experience with the technology in question.

60
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,015
So far so good,

61
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:47,355
let's try another example.

62
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:54,510
Again, try pausing the video here to evaluate the expression of interest yourself first.

63
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,490
All right. In this expression of interest,

64
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,245
we start with talking about

65
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:04,895
our extensive experience of working on building web applications,

66
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:08,515
which is the clients main ask in the job description.

67
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:14,165
Then we get deeper into the applications and websites that we have built.

68
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:20,765
Then we talk about the client's exact ask followed by a tip for the client,

69
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:24,650
demonstrating your expertise in the area as

70
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,480
well as an inclination to make things more efficient for the client.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,010
All this is good except for the fact that we start by talking

72
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,425
about our own experience and not with the client's problem statement.

73
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:43,010
As you send more and more expression of interests,

74
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,880
you'll notice that the response rate is higher when you start talking

75
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,125
about the client's task at hand first and how you can solve it.

76
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:56,165
This immediately catches the eye of the client and this chart, reading attentively.

77
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:59,090
You can backup your claims then by talking about

78
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,230
your skills and experience later in your expression of interest.

79
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,880
This is an improved version of the same expression of interest,

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,330
where we start with the reiterating the problem statement at a high level,

81
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,220
followed by a tip,

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,780
and further followed up by details on our experience and relevant skills.
