00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,565
Let's dig deeper into the kind of mindset we're talking about here.

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,580
Now when you work on projects for clients,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,265
you will often be facing choices.

4
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:15,135
For example, choice of what tools to use,

5
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:20,340
choice of whether to build a solution from scratch or use an off-the-shelf solution,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,535
choice of which pricing framework to use.

7
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:26,190
Now while you are making these choices,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,580
if you always view at the client's heart to think about

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,800
them and see how you can maximize value for the client,

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,790
it's a great long-term strategy to evolve your freelancing carrier.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,680
Now that might seem counter-intuitive to many

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,770
of us who are starting out our freelancing carriers.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,550
We're of course here to make money through freelancing and do

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,220
many freelancing gigs with many clients to make that money,

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,084
which is our priority.

16
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,589
No doubt that is our priority.

17
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,430
But when working with a mindset of maximizing value for the client,

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,340
you will realize that will pay you back in

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,175
the long-term as well as the short-term in numerous cases.

20
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:12,465
But I would say do not take my word for it.

21
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,715
Try it out, test,

22
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:19,060
and see where this attitude and mindset takes you.

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,844
If a client realizes that you made them save money by working smartly,

24
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:26,440
like using the right tools, being efficient,

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,600
they may leave you a good review,

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,465
which would be helpful to get hired for future jobs and get more clients.

27
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:37,510
Also, if a client finds out through

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,170
another freelancer of a more efficient way to do things,

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,405
they may no longer be interested in you and may just go with the other freelancer.

30
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:52,720
However, when they know that you are conscious about efficiency of time and their money,

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,235
you might be their first choice if and when they have more work in the future.

32
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:04,380
Lastly, it will give you the satisfaction of a job well done.
