1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,885
Now let's dive in a little deeper into freelancing platforms,

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:07,395
and see how we can use them to source clients.

3
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,905
Freelancing platform is a marketplace,

4
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:14,980
a marketplace of clients and freelancers.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,260
Now a marketplace is all about matchmaking.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,930
Lots of service providers who are freelancers

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,035
like you are willing to provide their services,

8
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:30,500
and lots of clients who are willing to hire these freelancers to avail their services.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,700
Now, each client in this marketplace has a task or

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,220
a project that they publish on this freelancing platform in this marketplace,

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,820
for which they are looking for someone to work on.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,765
Their interest is in picking one freelancer who is

13
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:52,370
available and qualified to work on that task.

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,120
Now let's walk through a mock-up of how a typical freelancing platform looks like.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,870
Now as one would expect,

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,175
the main dashboard of

17
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:05,915
any freelancing platform would have a list of job requests from clients,

18
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:10,835
which means tasks or projects that the clients want to get done.

19
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:14,350
This request usually has four elements.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,420
A title or a description of the project,

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,855
which gives a brief idea of what the project is about.

22
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,525
Usually when you click on that specific request,

23
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,630
it leads you to another page describing this project

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,720
in more detail if the client did put those details.

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,475
Then it also has a proposed payment type.

26
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:37,225
Whether fixed costs or hourly.

27
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:41,050
Then a proposed cost that the client is willing to pay.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,825
This will either be an hourly rate or an end-to-end fixed cost,

29
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,840
depending on the payment type.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,425
You will see us covering the fixed costs and the hourly rates later in this course.

31
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:56,335
You'll also see different skills that the project requires.

32
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:59,690
This could include programming languages that they want to use,

33
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,105
or off-the-shelf tools they're using,

34
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,074
or even high level domains like web development,

35
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:08,995
digital marketing, android app development, and so on.

36
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,620
A dashboard would usually have a filter section

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,115
where you could filter the type of projects that you want to see.

38
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:19,160
For example, if you're interested in projects that pay by the hour,

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,540
you could use that filter.

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,945
Or if you'd like to see projects requiring some specific skills,

41
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,705
you could filter by those skills.

42
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:31,040
Almost all of the freelancing platforms have such useful dashboards that help you

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,935
see the tasks or projects that you're looking for and apply to those.

44
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:41,690
Now it is worth mentioning here that freelancing platforms have gone a step

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,420
further and try to use Deep Tech to decide which jobs to show to which will freelancer,

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,020
depending on a lot of parameters.

47
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,180
This enables different freelancers to see

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,200
different jobs instead of everyone seeing the same list,

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,480
hence increasing relevancy and reducing competition.
