1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
The first thing that you would do when you sign up on

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,035
a freelancing platform is to create a profile.

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:10,605
Now let's take a look at what a profile is.

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:14,325
When a client publishes a task on a freelancing platform,

5
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,290
you as a freelancer,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,670
would send an expression of interest to the client to express your interest in this task.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,865
But even before the client considers your expression of interest,

8
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:31,275
they may look at a profile on the platform, your profile.

9
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:34,770
Now profile is nothing but information about you.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,929
A short bio about yourself,

11
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,240
educational background, areas of expertise,

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,105
and then relevant projects that you've worked on.

13
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:48,124
One might think that a profile is nothing but a resume of a freelancer.

14
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:51,910
But profile is actually a little different from a resume

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,930
that you would use to perhaps into companies to get full-time jobs.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,255
Now let's look at what are the main differences between a profile and a resume.

17
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:06,260
First, a profile is much more brief and direct and it's

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,380
strong as compared to a resume which is more detailed and sophisticated.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,480
But let's take an example to explain that point.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,555
If you have a skill of full-stack development,

21
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:23,430
you may want the client to know what exactly you walk on and what's your core strength.

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,584
In a freelancing profile,

23
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,640
it's okay to say that you have mostly worked on

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,165
Python and done some doublings in front-end technologies,

25
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,730
which is not the kind of brevity and

26
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,210
the language that you would use on a sophisticated resume.

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,550
Second, a resume which is also used actively

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,495
for full-time jobs has many other details than your core work.

29
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:51,320
It could talk about your co-curricular activities, for example,

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,600
like you are a black belt in karate,

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,765
or could talk about your volunteering experiences,

32
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:59,590
or even talk about your career objectives.

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,460
Those details are generally not relevant in a freelancing profile.

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,475
The prime reason for that is that freelancing market is more direct and need-based.

35
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:16,550
Clients are only interested in seeing what you can do for them for their project at hand.

36
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,610
Whereas when applying for a full-time job using a resume,

37
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,750
a a company may also be interested in knowing about your soft skills,

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,130
other activities that you do, and so on.

39
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,590
The third, which you might have guessed by now,

40
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,615
is that freelancing profiles are less formal than resumes.

41
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:37,970
It's totally okay to say in your bio that you will not

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,529
charge if the client is not a 100 percent satisfied with your services,

43
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,390
which is not something that you would put on a resume for sure.

44
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:53,074
In a nutshell, the client only wants to know if you can work on their task effectively.

45
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,880
They're not interested if you're a runner or you run

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,510
a YouTube channel on cooking with 100,000 subscribers,

47
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,115
unless it's directly relevant to their work.

48
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:07,565
Now before getting into the different fields of a profile,

49
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:13,090
we will discuss some general best practices that will help you write a good profile.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,700
Remember that every freelancing platform will have

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,065
their own set of fields to fill in to create a freelancer's profile.

52
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:24,260
The first one is derived from the fact that clients

53
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,320
are not reading your profile but skimming it.

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,755
Try to be as crisp and brief as possible,

55
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,895
highlighting your key strengths and experience.

56
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:38,600
This goes back to our mindset discussion on maximizing value for the client.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
Try to hear the clients had and see what you would

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,170
look in a profile if you were hiring someone to do a task,

59
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,420
add those specific details.

60
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,900
Now one mistake that freelancers often make is

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,965
just putting down a long list of the skills that they know.

62
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:58,220
In general, that is not a bad practice because

63
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,150
the freelancing platforms encourage you to tag all your skills.

64
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,600
You can filter client requests based on the skills that you have put in your profile.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,950
But it is important to also call out your core expertise in your profile.

66
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,640
For example, it's okay to mention that you know PHP,

67
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,935
Python [inaudible] Bootstrap, and React.

68
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,919
But it's good to mention your core strengths.

69
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,725
This will help the client know what is really

70
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:30,280
your deep skill and what you can work on with little exploration if needed.

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,320
Lastly, nothing better for a client to be able to see your work done in the past.

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,845
This will help the client relate your past work with

73
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,765
their project and help them assess whether you are a good fit.

74
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,910
If you have links to your past work that is not predicted

75
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,020
by a non-disclosure agreement and is available publicly,

76
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,670
do share them in your profile.
